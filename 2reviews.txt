        "content": "This is the pinnacle of anime games on Steam. For this to be a different genre then the other Persona or Shin Megami Tensei games, it plays almost like any other game in the series. It's the same general loop of fusing demons and abusing elemental weaknesses, but with hack and slash combat instead of the usual turn based combat. The open world, Dynasty Warriors-esque style works great for this series. The soundtrack is great. I did have some issues like crashes on cut scenes from time to time. I had to rollback my Nvidia drivers to get past a crash and progress at one point as well. Despite being soft-locked until I rolled back drivers and occasional crashing, the game is very enjoyable. Solid 9/10 overall.",

Other than the (sometimes) low fps drops and the game either crashing or having an infinite black screen, it's a great game and I recommend this to anyone who's either looking for a new game to try or is a fan of the Persona series! I pre-ordered the digital deluxe version of the game thinking I'd be happy, but this game BLEW my expectations out of the park! Really glad I pre-ordered it when I did. By far the combat is the biggest and best change to this game, very different and stylish compared to it's predecessors, it really works well and is better than I thought it would be! All and all, a very good game!!",

The rich persona story and formula is met with a very good adaptation of the action style combat system akin to something of warriors games/new Final Fantasy games. While this is a sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) from what I've played so far there is some prior knowledge needed about that game to enjoy this one, fortunately if you've never played P5 it shouldn't be a huge issue. Shockingly there haven't been any insanely big P5 spoilers yet, and I don't expect there to be. The music in this game is phenomenal, and the overall design of the Jails really does feel like Palaces from P5. You knocked it out of the park with this one Atlus!\n",

The battle system is more dynamic than the average warriors game, and it still stays true to the narrative and social style of the original Persona 5 as much as it can (it doesnt have social links, but has a bond system and is still very aesthetically pleasing). The only issue I've had with it so far is the loading times every now and then after launching the game, but other than that, I don't see any reason not to play the game if you're a fan of Koei Tecmo warriors games and liked or watched gameplay of Persona 5.",

        "content": "Redoing this since I've actually finished the adventure now, by god what a brilliant sequel.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great return to the world of the Phantom Thieves filled with just as much excitement as the original.\nAs this game is still really new (Review posted a couple of days after the release) I'll keep my thoughts brief so players can enjoy the experience on their own.\n\n[u]Story:[/u]\nFor starters this [b] IS [/b] a sequel, however its a sequel to the original Persona 5 and not Royal. If you have not played the original you will be missing out a lot in the experience, some stuff straight up won't make sense (Hopefully someday Atlus releases the original to PC as well).\n\nAlthough not as long as the first instalment, P5S's story involves the Phantom Thieves taking a road trip all over Japan. This new setting really allowed the developers to expand more on the world of the Persona franchise with many hints to previous games (Haha Hotspring incident). The story is told incredibly well and is a nice change of pace avoiding rehashing the first games plot too much. \n\nFun Fact:\nFunnily enough, this exact concept is what the original Persona 5 developers wanted for the first game although it was scraped due to inappropriate timing alongside real world events (Great East Japan Earthquake).\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nAs the game was made in combination with ATLUS and Omega Force (The company behind the Warrior fighting games such as Dynasty Warriors, Hyrule Warriors etc) The gameplay is [b] very [/b] different to any other Persona game in the franchise. Instead of the same turn based combat found across the series, you are instead greeted to Warriors-Styled Hack&Slash gameplay which pairs extremely well with Personas core concepts. I would be confident saying the combat style rivals the turn based nature of the other games in the franchise, although it sometimes can feel pretty messy with everything happening at once cluttering up your screen. It is certainly a tonne of fun though.\n\nIn future I would honestly be down to see a full Persona game adopting this fighting style again. Of course keep the turn based combats for the main releases, however if Omega Force wants to partner with ATLUS for another Persona/Warriors game, I'm most certainly down.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nHoly fuck, the music in this game is amazing. P5S basically takes the original P5's soundtrack and mixes it with more upbeat styles to fit the more quickened gameplay, with heaps of rock elements added alongside. \n\nIt would be a sin against this game to not give the soundtrack a perfect score as a minimum, Its that good. \n\n[u]Wrapping it Up:[/u]\nAs stated above, I really don't want to go too deep into the story elements as this game is still very new. Just know it gets an almost perfect score from me with its only flaw being it had to follow the original, and that in all honesty is unfair. \n\nif you have played Persona 5/Royal and your looking for more Phantom Thief action, pick this one up.\n\n\n\n\n\n [h1] Makoto best girl btw [/h1]",

This is a straight forward beat em up with a Persona flavour and I can understand why they had to tone down on certain elements of the game. Overall this is a fun side adventure that lets you spend more time with your favourite characters and travel all over Japan.",

        "content": "This review is coming from a player who has not played Persona 5.\nI played Persona 4 when it released on steam and loved it and I was very much interested in the art style of Persona 5 and also followed its release and reviews on PS4. But I don't own any console and wanted to experience. So when P5S was announced I was very much excited, then I come to know that it will be pretty different experience than mainline series with hack and slash gameplay but with characters of P5. I was in a doubt whether I will enjoy this or not because of lack of connections with the lore + characters from the P5. But still I went for it.\nNow the question is did I enjoy this? \nYes, absolutely (to my surprise!)\nCharacters are introduced in a way you get a chance to know about them and chemistry between them (yes, it won't match the connection you might have if played P5 but still its serviceable)\nGameplay is fun and will keep you playing.\nOne big con for the port is that it's unstable as hell (I played early access version so it might not reflect the product on release day) as I experienced multiple crashes when changing between the locations. [This problem has bigger consequence because the game doesn't have autosave system and you can only save at particular locations. So, there is a chance that you might lose large chunk of progress, thus I advise you to save frequently.)\nSo to conclude, I am enjoying the game. Yes, I would have enjoyed it more if (1) I didn't face so many crashes and (2) had played Persona 5.\nSo I do recommend this game to anyone who has played the previous game, but if you haven't I suggest you go with an open mind and you might enjoy the company of the Phantom Thieves.\n\u00a0\nPS- Please ATLUS, don't leave players like me hanging, and give us a PC port of Persona 5 Royal.",

        "content": "As someone who never really played Musou games, P5S was originally an odd concept but i was willing to give it a shot on account of it being more Persona 5 and a good excuse to spend time with the Phantom Thieves. \n\nI expected it to be a Musou game with a P5 skin but what we have here is a Persona game with Musou mechanics. The charm and style of Persona is dominant and is present in everything. If you enjoyed the cast and story of P5, but not the combat, i would 100% recommend this as it truly feels like a P5 sequel with action combat and no social management (but don't worry, you'll spend plenty of time in running around, in cut scenes and story beats with your crew. \n\nOverall, as a huge fan of P5, this is a must. The combat is fast pace and refreshing and absolutely captures the essence of the original game. I wish it did have some social stuff but as a spin off, it's fine as is. \n\nMy one slight negative is that if you never played P5 or watched the story, they don't really explain much and it does jump right in after the events of P5 so new players, be aware that some of the game kinda expect you to know what previously happened. \n\nOn the technical side, i'm playing on an ultra-wide monitor at 3440x1440 with a 2080ti and the performance is flawless. constant 75+ fps. No frame loss but i will say that at this time, the game does not support ultra-wide so i get black bars on the side do restrict it to 2560x1440. Not aware of any workaround for that yet.",

        "content": "Look if you haven't played Person 5 (not strikers but the original game, which has not released on PC yet sadly), then you might find it a bit jarring the be dropped into an already well-developed friend group and story+setting which all the characters will already pretend you are already a part of.\n\nI fall into the category myself. I think it is a bit strange for ATLUS to release a sequel to Persona 5 on PC because, again, it can be rather awkward.\n\nI will say that this game is EXTREMELY pretty. Another plus is that, unlike Persona 4 where you feel like you're playing a Hero, this game makes me feel like I'm playing a BADASS. Persona 4 has one of favorite games of all time, but never did that game have me smile in satisfaction over the gameplay.\n\nNow, remember before buying that if you haven't played the original Persona 5 that you will be missing out on a TON of backstory. I knew this myself when I got the game and I'm sorta just rolling with it. It's a bit like if you started Game of Thrones starting in season 3, which from my experience is also really awkward. On the flip side it makes going through to previous stories rather fun because then you get a \"prequel\" feel from them.\n\nPersonally this is a 7/10, which will probably be bumped up to a 10/10 when the original game comes out. I'm actually rather confident it'll be a 10/10 but without knowing the backstory to such a dramatic extent I don't know whether or not the current story is good or not. I wouldn't recommend this to someone on PC who hasn't played the original Persona 5, unless like me they were willing to overlook a bunch of missing backstory.",

        "content": " I have played through the game enough to now have a better written opinion of it. In general, I think this is a good game and enjoyed most of my time with it. However, there is definitely parts I did not like.\n\nStory:\n For the most part, I thought the story was fun. There were times where it got dull or just felt extremely rushed that I didn't like, but I overall liked the story. There is a decent amount of parts that do feel like reuses of things that happened in the series before, mainly Persona 5. Those didn't really bother me too much except for at a certain point in the story that I just found to be extremely lazy writing. I also found two of the villains to either be too \"evil\" or not a bad person for the most part.\n\nGameplay:\n Personally I love the gameplay. I find it really fun and a unique twist on the gameplay style for the type of game this is. If you are not a fan of the beat em up style of Warriors games, then you'll probably not like the gameplay as much. However, there is enough differences in my opinion that would make it worth a shot atleast. It also has the dungeon crawling of a normal Persona game, just not exactly the same. There is more expansive spaces than a typical Persona game.\n\nCharacters:\n For the most part I really liked the returning cast and the new cast added to this game. There were some points I found the returning cast used the same jokes too much, but other than that I liked them about as much as in P5/P5R. I honestly loved the new main cast characters. I found their character arcs, story and personality amazing. They were just overall really good characters. There were some not as major characters that I really liked as well. Overall, I just really liked the characters of this game.\n\nSound:\n I absolutely loved the soundtrack of this game. All the returning songs were great and all the new songs were amazing. There are even remixes of some returning songs and those remixes are so so good. The rest of the sounds were overall pretty good. There were only a few times where I didn't think sounds fit what was going on. As an example, there were some moves that just didn't fit the noise they made and threw me off.\n\n \n In the end, I still feel this is a really good game and a pretty good sequel to Persona 5. I also think it could fit for P5R a bit more than I originally thought when I got it. However, I'd only really recommend getting it if you're a fan of Persona, specifically Persona 5, and if you like the gameplay style. There is also a decent amount of bugs that have been reported and a few I have had, but they are working on them. Atlus recently put out a hotfix beta that, since using, I have not had any problems with the game.",

        "content": "32 hours in and I just got past Jail number [spoiler] 5 [/spoiler] and I'm thoroughly hooked. Brings me right back to April of 2017. I've been playing this on the Digital Deluxe Pre-release, and while there are a few issues with loading screens, they'll likely be fixed with the day one patch.\n\nGameplay wise, this FEELS like Persona, but as an action game. There's some Dynasty Warriors/Musou influence, yes, but it doesn't have the same map control/base defense loop that Musou often has in its spinoffs (e.g. Hyrule Warriors) and instead opts to give much more of the stage to Persona 5. For returning fans, Fusion is back, but it's less about picking which Personas you want to fuse, and is a bit more linear. The most important part is getting different Personas, since EACH ONE will CHANGE Joker's moveset in few ways, and the Persona he has equipped can freely cast some preset skills (tied to each individual Persona) by using his Persona combo finishers. You can still fuse some pretty impressive Personas if you want to, with Reflect/Absorbs and the like, but it's not as important.\n\n\nThe other characters all feel really, really good; even in comparison to Joker, and they EACH have their own unique attribute to set them apart! Basically, Ryuji's ability is charged attacks, Makoto's is motorcycle, Haru can hold her strong attacks out, etc.. Building your party around which playstyles you like right from the get go is nice too.\n\nStory wise and in play, it feels like Persona 5-2. Some scenes have already gotten to me emotionally, and if you wanted less black-and-white themes in Persona 5 and more gray, you should be pleased with the Jail Monarchs in this game. Jumping right back in with the old cast feels natural, and while you can tell the writers had fun referencing the community, everyone feels like they're still them.\nI also like the implication that everyone isn't starting from ground zero as Phantom Thieves; they're rusty, but they're still more than capable of taking out hordes of shadows by themselves.\n\nI don't like out of 10 ratings, so I'll say this is a damn fun game and I recommend it to anyone who likes Persona 5. If you haven't played 5, I do REALLY recommend playing that first, but this game honestly doesn't do a terrible job reviewing what is what for first timers.\nEven if you don't like Musou, you might be pleasantly surprised.",

        "content": "Dare I say, this is even better than the original P5.\nI love the rpg genre as a whole, and Persona 5 does an amazing job with it, but the action style \"dynasty warriors\" gameplay of this manages to get me a lot more invested in the game.\nYou feel like such a badass mowing through crowds of enemies with huge AoE attacks.\nThe story is also really interesting. I love the whole \"roadtrip across japan\" thing they have going on.\n[spoiler] The structure of the villains isn't too bad either, I love the idea of showing a character that's pretty much every respective phantom thief if they had taken a different route in life. [/spoiler]\nAlso Haru is the best girl in all of existence so any more interactions with her is always a plus in my book.\n\nThe only 2 cons I can see are kind of nit-picky.\n1: It doesn't include any mention of the additional story of p5 royal, but I can understand that since the japanese version of this game released before royal was added. That doesn't stop me from wanting to see more of Kasumi and Maruki, though.\n2: There's a few quality of life features taken away compared to base persona 5, like not being able to \"jog\" in the overworld. I can understand that since it was developed in part by a different studio, though.\n\nEasily the best thing in this game is that it doesn't feel like it's 90% cutscenes and it doesn't super hold your hand in the beginning like p5 did. Heck, you can skip cutscenes entirely if you want, rather than having to fast forward through them.\n\n[b] Overall: Phenomenal game. I can easily see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this game trying to 100% it, like I have with every other Persona game, from 1 to 5. \nIf you enjoy games like dynasty warriors or hyrule warriors, and you like the story of persona 5, I can not recommend this game enough.[/b]",

Its quite the opposite, being a persona game at heart with only a little bit of warriors thrown in there. Sure it doesnt have the social aspect the series is known for, but everything else is here, the great cast (from vanilla, no Sumi :( ), great dialogue and great voice acting. Its also longer then you would expect, so thats good. The combat feels very fresh, even for those that dont like the warriors games. All aspects of battle from p5 are still here, 1 mores, follow ups, all out attacks and even showtimes from royal. If youre a fan of the series, youll love it, even if it is a bit repetitive at first.\n\nBut \n\nIts got some problems on PC, so I would recommend getting it on PS4. Or run it off an SSD",

If you're a fan of either Persona and/or Dynasty Warriors, or a newcomer to both series, you might enjoy it.\n\nSince this is also part of Persona 5, it is very newcomer friendly with no spoils to the original game.",

Basically, you'll want to string together your attacks to deal good damage. While you won't have access for particularly amazing personas for a while, I've never really had too many issues regarding battles with the personas you start with. As for the story, from where I'm at, it's amazing. It integrates old characters and obviously includes some new ones. The new characters are quite interesting, and will leave you in suspense until the end! This is a quick and messy review, but this really is an amazing game!! :)",

        "content": "It's not a regular Persona game so if its your first one I recommend Golden first. \n\nIt's still really fun and I genuinely enjoy myself. The bugs for now however need to be fixed. Still 1000 percent recommend, but the crashing and lag in cutscenes among numerous other glitches just take away from the experience for a bit. I have already for example lost 2 hours of play time due to crashing. \n\nYou should still buy it, its really fun and a unique twist. \nSave frequently and if your cutscenes are screwed like mine you can find them on YouTube to watch them to full potential\n\n\nEdit: After finishing game, its up there on my favourite games list. As much as the fandom groans and complains about milking the series the quality for the product is really here with Strikers. The new characters are great, I'm still not sure how I feel about Royal not being connected what so ever plus the weird ending of Royal. If we take that out of the picture I think this ending after connecting to base P5 is really good. Once again the OST is phenomenal as with pretty much every Persona game. Definitely some things I'm going to add to my playlist from this game. The combat also feels really good and is a unique change of pace that still keeps Persona mechanics. \n\nMy only gripes with this game are the bugs. I know Atlus is working on it however I did not get a single cutscene that wasn't a laggy mess. As I mentioned above I had to go on YouTube to see them to their full potential. That being said when they aren't a laggy mess the cutscenes and the characters/environments look great here.\n\nFrom here on forward I couldn't really say whether I'd rather P5's characters get more arc or not. One could obviously make the argument that its being milked harder then P4 even but I wouldn't complain with one last sendoff from the P5 cast. Whether it be a P5 arena or a completely new spinoff. Or we could immediately go to P6 which I wouldn't complain about either. \n\nI started with P5 as my first game and then played P4 here on Steam. Who knows what in store for the anniversary but I would love to see P3 get the Persona 4 Remaster treatment. Beyond that, if Atlus started bringing more releases to Steam I think that would be great. \n\nTime for me to wait to try out Nocturne as my first entry into SMT",

I won't say I enjoy the battles as much as in original entry, but I do feel more immersed in the battles (also, sometimes AI does some crazy shit and you must fight 1 vs boss, which I find quite confusing).  Also, I should not that you won't have as much social interactions as in previous entry, which might disappoint some people.\n\nThe plot feels strong (tho I find it a little bit repetitive), new characters are unique as it usually happens in Persona games.\n\nAnyway, if you are a Persona 5 and/or hack-slash games fan, you should get this game. It would be VERY preferable to play Persona 5 Royal or Persona 5 before playing this to better understand the plot and how the game world works, but it's not on PC (yet?). \n\nP.S. This review is based in the first 10 hours of the game. I'll update it when I finish it",

The new combat system feels quite nice, sure, it has its problems, the original key mapping (Keyboard) is not quite pleasant at least from my perspective, but is very configurable, which will give you a chance to accommodate a lot better. In the same way, other minor detail such as the mouse camera that can be a little weird.\n\nWithout anything else to say, the only thing to conclude is that P5S is a great successor, the story as per usual is very entertaining and the whole game itself is very good.\n\nHighly recommended",

        "content": "so, I just put the game down after a long time, finished it, and I actually really like it. For context, long time fan, my first game was Persona 3 for the PS2, didn't finish, came back and finished P3FES around 2011, then bought a vita for P4G a little later, and fell in love with the franchise. I routinely get people into persona so you can imagine my surprise seeing P4G, then this game on steam! That being said, I decided to wait out persona 5 royal for a PC release, but I have played the original P5, so I had to grab this.\n\nWhat a great game! I think this is the best Persona spin off yet, having played the dancing games, fighting games, and persona Q. My last game of theirs was the -- rather disappointing-- Persona Q2. This game, though, Ignore the price tag, it's deserving off the full price, even being a spin off, it feels more like a sequel, with eight dungeons, and a ton to do. The combat is less dynasty warriors than I was expecting, and leans more toward a standard ARPG moveset. Playing on normal, you actually had to pay attention to weaknesses, and definitely couldn't just button mash through the game.\n\nPersona spinoff tropes like the throwaway characters are present here, but I actually liked the characters they added, which I almost never do, except the ones from Persona Q. The areas felt new and interesting, I loved the layout, and things felt much more expansive than Persona 5's Palaces, and that's saying a TON because those were already pretty fleshed out. One is a police officer in a troubled relationship with his daughter and the other is a robot questioning how to be human, which are character designs that are molded from persona 4 and 3 respectively. I was disappointed at first, but they really turned the characters into their own, and they sort of molded into their own, I left the game enjoying their characters a lot more than I did coming in, especially the police officer.\n\nI'm not too fond of the cast of Persona 5 and I still found myself pretty invested in the story. Right when the Palace format started to get boring, they switched things up and had an unexpected ending. That being said, there are a few spoilers for Persona 5, however I believe this game doesn't exist in the continuity of Persona 5 : Royal, so if you're worried about spoilers for that game, you're good. That being said, you have to wonder why we don't have Persona 5, or Royal on steam yet. I know for sure that there are people waiting to play this, since it's basically a sequel to the original. The character and bonus content that was revealed in Royal doesn't seem to affect the cast of this game's continuity, very strange considering the events of P3FES are considered canon, same for P4G.\n\n\nGreat port, I had a few crashes but they were following about 7 hours of consecutive play (oops). Other than that, great optimization, Persona 5's graphics look so much better at 4K 60fps! Great job as always Atlus, i'd love to see Royal on here, as well as Persona Q and some of the other spin off games! If you're on the fence, grab it to support Atlus' PC presence! They were already pretty Anti-PC for years, and i'm thinking the sales of P4G are what coaxed them into releasing more on here. Amazing game, the soundtrack I actually like better than the original. Another banger Atlus title.",
