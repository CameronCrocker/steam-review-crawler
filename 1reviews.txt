        "content": "Pretty fun, but the grind for the bond exp trophy is a terrible slog that I'm in the midst of. Other than that, my only other complaint is that my Xbox controller is very particular when it comes to this game. You have to wait to connect the controller until the game is running. If you don't, the game will bug out and constantly switch the button icons from Xbox to PS and the button mapping gets funky.\n\nThat aside, this game was a good experience. You'll want to have played P5 or P5R in order to fully grasp the story. The combat was difficult to grasp at first, but after a few hours I got the hang of it, especially after I figured out how to get my controller to work with the game. \n\nWith that being said, I doubt I'll come back to this game after I get all of the achievements for it, or at least not any time soon. It's a great game, and the mainline Persona games are probably my favorite video games of all time, but it doesn't really hold a candle to the mainline games. Most of the enjoyment I got from this game was just getting more Phantom Thieves content.",

        "content": "Ayyyye, I'm back again with another review...I know, I know, who goes from Travis Strikes Again to Persona 5 Strikers? I don't know, I'm just wack with my taste, I guess. Still working on The Silver Case too, and I'm almost done with [i] that [/i] game too. Anyways, it's showtime!:\n\n[h1] The Narrative/Story [/h1]\n\nWell...it's a lot like Persona 5's original story (whether it be Vanilla or Royal, doesn't matter cause they both segway into Strikers.) This time around, you've travelling all around Japan and saving the world once again! Everyone gets their own moments to shine in the story again, which is nice and we do see the development from P5 show up here. It's hard to really comment on as it really just boils down to the Phantom Thieves (along with a couple of members, one of which is unironically one of the best parts about the game.) \n\nThe locations chosen work with the story and the pacing and writing were fine, better than Vanilla 5's writing in my opinion. I think the themes that felt a little tacked on in the original are either written better here or the new themes (like family issues in Haru's case, not going into any spoilers) are decently enough written. The entire of the game....mehhh...it's kinda cheesy, maybe I'm just used to the Persona formula of having happy but sad endings, but it still had me invested through the end.\n\nI'll give it either a A-/B+, it's alright. Not the best writing in the world, but far from the worst...trust me...I'm...not so fond of some of P3's writing in particular, but we'll save that for when Persona 3 Portable gets ported to PC sometime next year...\n\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n\nProbably the best aspect about this game. Being a Muso game (and having played Hyrule Warriors on Wii U a long time ago), I actually really enjoyed this game's gameplay. Sure, after a while, it gets a bit repetitive, but upgrading you and your party members as well as mastering new skills by just doing combos and whatnot freshens the game up a bit, not to mention you're [i] always [/i] getting new Personas and strengthening them, getting them new skills just like in normal P5. A lot of the mechanics carried over quite well to this game and in my opinion, this is one of the best Muso games I've played (which isn't saying much because again, I've only played Hyrule Warriors before this game that was back when the game came out.)\n\nThe only issue I have with it is that if you like doing side content, getting some of the [i] really [/i] good demons and having the best equipment possible for everyone like me, you'll have to do quite a bit of grinding for money and Persona Points (PP for short...kind of an really overused term in RPGs if you ask me.) I'd say it's mostly worth it get to awesome Personas like Yoshitsune, Alice, and Mara and with the ability to pitch which skills to inherit when fusing, skill-swapping for Joker's Personas any time in overworld in the Persona menu, and a constant flow of new Personas, grinding shouldn't be too bad, I'd say money's the biggest issue and even then there's ways around it. So I guess the only complaint I have with it asides from it potential repetitiveness is that it's a little grindy, especially towards the end.\n\nA-, it's pretty solid stuff and I'm genuinely surprised how the mechanics from Persona/SMT carried over into a Hack N' Slash as well as they did here.\n\n[h1] The Visual/Audio Design [/h1]\n\n[i] *Sigh* [/i] Yeah... this is one of the weaker parts of this game. Let me get the graphics out of the way first, though.\n\nVisually, the game looks great! The overworlds are nice and detailed and look great without suffering any performance issues (which surprises me quite a bit given that I've heard Muso games usually have pretty bad PC ports or at least mediocre ones that have their issues) and the effects like the ones seen on the Personas is nice. The menu, while not [i] as [/i] stylish as P5's original menus are still pretty nice here and definitely have their own flair and are relatively easy to navigate (minus the menu before the final boss which was...kind of clunky.) I really can't complain about anything visually with the game, the models are all nice, the FMVs both pre-rendered and animated are quite nice and the game looks pretty good for game that was on Switch and PS4 originally (the former suffering pretty badly from framerate issues from what I've heard.) Point is, it looks good, Atlus did great with this game's visually just as I'd expect them to.\n\nNow the audio....uhhh...well...it's not great. Let's start with the voice-acting. I kinda feel like a few of the cast members forgot how to do their original character's voices, Ryuji sounded kinda off here and there especially and so did Joker, and some of the other character's actual audio sounds quieter or louder than others which is also kind of distracting. You can definitely tell this game was recorded during COVID while the everyone was at home, but they certainly tried and to be fair, the further along the game goes everyone sounded just fine again, so I guess it was just a few lines from everyone that got a little messed up. The acting for the new characters were perfect! Loved Zenkichi's VA's performance especially, he absolutely nailed the character and really made the banter between the Thieves lively. Sophia's...fine too, I can't really say anything about her without going into spoilers, but she did fine with her roll too. A- stuff, if only because of the few lines that could've been re-recorded to sound better and...not forcing people to record from home and just have them socially distance and record in a studio, it is what is, though.\n\nAs for the music...well...I was told not to use the default music and to just use the Persona BGM DLC I'd bought with my Deluxe Edition I got about a year ago (...yeah, this game's been on my backlog for A WHILE now...and the other DLC is kinda whatever, I used it for the beginning of the game and never used it again, so it kinda felt like a waste, I forgot to mention that in gameplay, but whatever) and while I enjoyed the DLC music being there for Persona 1-4, the other music was okay too, nothing special and it got a little repetitive hearing the same few battle songs over and over again, but there's some original music in here (namely Daredevil) which are absolutely [i] banging [/i] tunes. I'd say the overall OST excluding the DLC music is a B+, it's alright, there's some good songs in there, but [i] a lot [/i] of the music was reused from OG P5, which is a little...I guess lame.\n\n[h1] The Verdict/Conclusion [/h1]\n\nWhile this game does have its issues of being a little grindy and being a little repetitive, it's a nice companion piece to P5 that I'm sure anyone would played the original game (and also likes Muso games and or Hack N' Slashes) will enjoy. I'd give it around a 7.5-8.0/10, nothing spectacular, but a solid game that kept me invested til the end. If you've got like 70 hours to spare like I did (I idled for some of my hours to get to 93.1, don't always believe my hours, Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 were also botched in that regard), then go for it.\n\nOh, but here's one piece of advice [b] PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE. WAIT FOR A SALE. [/b] Yes, I know this game's only a year old, but that doesn't excuse it for being overpriced (especially with the DLC like...really? $10 for a BGM pack, jeez man. Meanwhile, Atlus is STILL pulling this kind of stuff with Nocturne HD Remaster and more atrociously and recently with Soul Hackers 2...which I'm not gonna even bother buying until it goes on sale because 1. I still wanna play the original and 2. I don't want pay $100+ for a new game, that's just ridiculous.), it's a good game, but not $60 good, $30 maybe at most.\n\nWell, if you're still up for it despite that, then it's showtime!\n\n\n[h1] Post-Review Ramble [/h1]\n\nSo uhhh...yeah. Hoping to finish The Silver Case soon and [i] that [/i] game's gonna be a fun one to review...just you wait...",

        "content": "P5R ON PC OUR DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE\n\nClickbait \u2018title\u2019 aside, Persona 5 Strikers is for sure worth your time coming off either vanilla P5 or P5R. A subtle hint I like about this game is the lack of confidants/social links, with the new BOND system taking its place. It says all the individual bonds between Joker and the rest of the regularly scheduled Phantom Thieves are as \u2018maxed\u2019 as much as possible, being more about enjoying the experiences of their trip around Japan and becoming a tighter group overall as opposed to the compartmentalized substories SLs tend to be. \n\nZenkichi and Sophia are also great additions with great character arcs, the former reminding me of previous Hierophant Arcana characters and their respective daughters, but this one being something the Phantom Thieves have an active, prolonged hand in that makes it feel very believable and relatable. Sohpia is a bit more predictable of an AI gaining sentience, but she still has a very heartwarming personality and conclusion. They both remind me quite a bit of Takuto Maruki, may Billy Kametz rest in piece. \n\nAs someone who has never played a Dynasty Warriors game, I have to say the combination of action and turn based combat from both series is put together seamlessly and the moment to moment gameplay flows perfectly. Baton passing and showtimes really make you feel like working as a team has true benefits and each interaction really brings each PT\u2019s character out, my favorite showtime being Zenkichi\u2019s. \n\nSo yeah, P5S is a great addition to the Persona series, even if a full $60 is a bit steep coming off 120+ hours from Royal. I\u2019d conclude it calling it a very heartwarming experience, that\u2019s the feeling I got from my time with it if I had to describe it in one word. Great straightforward story that lets us see our favorite delinquents again and seamless gameplay that is punchy, cathartic and as stylish and over-the-top as ever. (And of course 10/10 music, especially randomized music from all past mainline Persona games, good one Atlus.)",

        "content": "My hours are elevated due to leaving it on when not playing. I originally played about 40 hours.  I wanted to like it...........I really did. However, there are some very \"meh\" aspects. First of which is the predictability in the flow of the game. Travel to new place, eat, find a new jail and liberate people, travel again......wash rinse and repeat. I suppose those things would be fine if they weren't each so shallow.  Each new area/place requires an investigation phase. This would simply mean talking to a few npcs..........and boom! Investigation is complete. The eating phase is simply the characters raving for about 2-3 minutes about what foods to eat in the area. This means nothing to you, the player, or to the story. It's done by cut-scenes. Ultimately it feels like a lot of the dialogue during this phase is just rehashed over and over. One character is excited about a certain food, and other characters mention alternatives.  The next issue is...............\n\nThe predictability of the issues surrounding the monarchs. Several of the monarchs have ties to members of your party, but it's not done in an interesting way. What's more, it follows the unfortunate pattern in anime-like games where it feels like every character has to say their \"piece\" regarding to a situation, and it's really not necessary........especially when they are just agreeing with each other in different words. \n\nThe gameplay is simplistic and while it may seem really cool about creating and improving new personas..........you will eventually start to lose enthusiasm despite multiple new personas being available at each level. Why? Because you will notice that the move-sets are the same as other personas and that the stats really don't vary that much when within 10 levels of each other. \n\nThe leveling is broken when you can earn as much experiance and more money in the beginning area of the 2nd jail than you can by the time you  can enter the 5th jail. The beginning area of the 2nd jail is one of the few areas where enemies respawn (including a near-500 exp enemy). Just continue to let yourself get detected and maintain it around the 30%-90% and go after the crystal enemy each time you hear it on the map.  The crystal enemy also gives about 500 exp. You can get up to a million yen in about an hour and level up quicker than most areas. \n\nUltimately, after the 4th jail and seeing everything start to repeat again on the 5th location/jail.........I just gave up and youtube-ed the ending.  Save your money. At least with Persona 5 there was a better overall story and had a dating aspect.",

Using Mosou mode with persona skills is special. Risky mode is quite challenging. I don't suppose it ended the story in emotional way. Maybe i'm really get into the game so i moved to tears while the ending. Really enjoy this game.",

        "content": "After spending 103 hours in Persona 5 Royal on the PS4 (PC port PLEASE), I breezed through Persona 5 Strikers in a measly 35 or so hours. \n\nWhile P5R is a turn based RPG with heavy social elements, P5S is an action game through and through with most of the RPG elements and social elements slimmed considerably or completely removed. It is still a hell of a lot of fun though. The combat against mobs can get old but the boss fights (of which there are plenty) are where the combat really shines and shows how excellent it is.\n\nThe story is a sequel to P5R and while the main narrative isn't nearly as engaging as the previous game's story (though still fun), the characters, both returning and new are just as excellent as always. They are what make the Persona 5 games so memorable and fun and they really shine here - P5R was their origin story and P5S is them getting to go on a new adventure already knowing each other. \n\nAnd that MUSIC...this soundtrack is amazing yall. Hard to not wanna punch something in the face when Daredevil starts playing.\n\nI will be saving my remaining side content (which is mostly just extra boss battles and finishing the persona registry) for a NG+ run down the road, but I am eager to return to this game sometime. \n",

        "content": "feels like a love letter to Persona fans. my only main-line experience is Persona 4 Golden, also very much enjoy 4 Arena. the systems already within the lore of Persona fit nicely into this Dynasty Warriors style game. I feel like you can skip main-line Persona 5 going into this as long as you have played one of the other games, such as Persona 4, so that you'll have a general understanding of the concepts. playing Persona 5 before this sure would have added more backstory to these specific characters but I don't feel it is required. \n\nIf you are a fan of the music in other Persona games this is more of the same, in a good way\n\n\nIn Closing, please bring this entire franchise to the PC because you will have all my dollars",

But, it fits the visual style of the predecessor Persona 5 perfectly. Also, playing P5 first is recommended, it contains the entire main cast and follows after the events of P5. Multiple story references to P5 too\n\nMusic and Visuals are A+ like you're used to\nFusion system like in the Persona series, but with roughly half as many Personas and skills.\nPlayable characters have different combat styles: buffing, fast/slow, status effects, etc.\nStory is similar to P5, writing quality is on par with most fanfiction. But, 90% voiced with great voice acting! Also in Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nMust buy for SMT fans. Also recommended for fans of Nier/DMC action games. If you're neither, check out some gameplay footage!",

        "content": "Let me get this out of the way - I am a HUGE Persona fan. I finished Persona 5 (2 times), Persona 4, I've played Dancing in the past, and I'm currently playing Q and 3.\n\nI CANNOT recommend this game. I am not a fan of Dynasty Warrior themed games. However, the problem goes beyond that. I didn't feel any... heart and soul in this spinoff. It just feels empty. I love the cities, they're beautifully designed and animated but... The dialogue isn't getting with me. It feels like dialogue that was created by an AI just for the sake of rushing out a half-baked story. The heroes don't feel like they're emotionally tied to the villains like they were in Persona 5, and beyond that? The villains just simply aren't interesting to begin with. It feels like they were just thrown into the mix for the sake of combat instead of them having a place in the story.\n\nThe perfect description for this game is generic. It's just not good, in my opinion. I found myself skipping through dialogue, and even skipping cutscenes. Cutscenes! I've never skipped anything in a Persona game prior to this game! A single sentence can easily sum up what was drug out through pages upon pages of generic, filler-like dialogue. And speaking of being drug out, I feel like this whole game is drug out through and through. As I got closer to the end of the game, I found myself wanting more and more for it to be over, groaning as I discovered 2 extra jails past what I believed to be the final boss.\n\nI will say this - this is the most advanced Dynasty Warrior themed game out there. And with that being said... It still manages to be a boring, repetitive slog in terms of gameplay. The combat is just X, with a few Y's thrown into the mix for a petty amount of combos you can do. The combat, in reality, just becomes spamming whatever ~Ma move hits everybody's weakness.\n\nToday, I'm gonna FORCE myself to finish this game, just for the sake of uninstalling it to free up space on my computer. Yeah, you heard that right, force. You should NEVER have to force yourself to finish a game, it means it just straight up isn't a fun/good game. It just feels like such a slog... As a person who literally completed New Game and New Game + of P5R back to back with no break, I'm heavily disappointed with this spinoff - and if I could... honestly? I'd refund it. I hope the next spinoff will be better.\n\nEdit: I was so bored playing this that ultimately \"forcing myself to play it today\" turned into forcing myself to play it spread out through a period of a few days. It's that boring to me.",

        "content": "P5S is a good Hack-and-Slash that can be enjoyed by any players, be it existing Persona fans or new players.\n\nP5S is a direct continuation from the base game, Persona 5, but can be enjoyed even without experiencing the base game itself. This allows Persona fans to enjoy the story continuing from its original ending, but also allow for new players, experiencing the Persona series for the first time, to enjoy the game. The story isn't anything too great but is good enough for an enjoyable experience. The story is very linear, meaning the choices made by your character will have no impact towards the endings. The dialogue options only affects how the other characters will respond and could make for some funny interactions between characters. The character interactions are great and provides lots of humorous and some badass moments.\n\nThe gameplay is where it truly deviates from the usual Persona Series. All previous installations of the Persona franchise (Not including spinoffs like Arena or the Dancing games) were mainly Turn-Based JRPG, but P5S is a Hack and Slash. \nThis makes the game more fast-paced and action packed but could be a turn off for those who enjoy the strategy of Persona games. \n\nP5S is also significantly shorter as compared to the other Persona games. It took me 40+ hrs to clear the base game and could easily be cleared in a shorter amount of time as I took the time to do every requests and search every nook and cranny of each jail. Also there is still New Game+ to play which could easily take me an additional 20hrs or so. Making the total game time to be around 50-60hrs.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a solid 7/10. Gameplay is good but certain parts felt repetitive (especially farming Persona Points to fuse certain Personas in the later part of the game). Story was pretty so-so but the character interactions were great. I would recommend buying this game on a sale for anyone who enjoys Hack-and-Slash or are Persona Fans.\n\nEDIT: Took me an additional 25hrs to complete all achievements. Have yet to complete NG+ playthrough, but doubt I would finish it. It is still a fun game to me but to 100% it did not feel as fun as just completing the game on the first run. It lacked the replayability that all base Persona games have but the challenge that Merciless posed in the early stages of NG+ was indeed quite challenging. However, once you fused a few max stats Personas, the game becomes quite a breeze and just knowing how to use Status Ailments and Technical to your advantage to wipe through most bosses relatively easily. This does not change my rating of it as to 100% a game is more of a perfectionist or if the game is really one of your favorites. In my case, its just that I really enjoy the Persona series and just wanted to 100% it as I wait for other Persona ports that.",

        "content": "If you liked Persona 5 you will love this game. I loved the game and only had minor issues with it. One being that the side mission requests can get very repetitive and boring especially at the end as you do the same things over and over again and get a ton of them especially near the end of the game. Also on hard difficulty, which is what I played the whole game on, some boss enemies get insanely bullet spongey as you wail on them for what seems like forever without much risk of dying. I also have a minor complaint in that the all out attacks seemed pointless at times as you would break the enemies guard only to deal an insanely small amount of damage after using what is supposed to be a finisher. I understand that it shouldn't just instant kill bosses, but sometimes I would use it and the boss health bar wouldn't even visibly move. In terms of positives there are countless including the near perfect transition from turn based to action combat as well as the excellent aesthetics and a story that tugged on my heart strings a couple of times.",

It's enjoyable to see the Phantom Thieves together again, joyfully hanging out one moment and deep in action dungeon-crawling the next. The gameplay is a drastic shift from turn-based Persona 5, but Koei Tecmo managed to revise their mindless hack-and-slash recipe from the Musou franchise to incorporate personas, the element and skill system into the action very well. It feels like I'm playing a normal Persona game, only with the real time action gameplay instead.

        "content": "TL:DR\nGameplay? Very Good\nSoundtrack? It's a banger \ud83e\udd18\nArtstyle / Graphics? Beautiful\nStory? Good\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA sequel to Persona 5 - The gameplay changes from the usual turn based combat that you can find in all Persona games to a hack-and-slash type combat you can find in games such as in the Dynasty Warrior series. While it does change the gameplay, the gameplay is very good, especially in Persona 5's artstyle. Gameplay is very good.\n\nSoundtrack can be described with one word: Amazing. The songs you'll usually hear in this game are remixes of songs you'll find in the original Persona 5, but do not get me wrong, THEY ARE NOT BAD! The remixes are just as good as the original songs they are remixed from. You'll enjoy the battle themes, boss themes, etc. The original songs made for this game though are good, while continuing to retain the Persona 5 OST's original style.\n\nThe artstyle is still the same as it was from Persona 5, and it looks gorgeous. As I said from earlier, the combat looks SO fantastic due to Persona 5's artstyle, making everything look flashy and just all around beautiful. Though, I can say it may be overwhelming for a small amount of people, but it wasn't for me.\n\nThe story isn't necessarily the best or what you expect from a Persona game, but it is a good sequel to Persona 5 story-wise. The story does take place a few months after the end of the original Persona 5, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion. For those who hasn't played Persona 5 originally, I wouldn't really recommend playing this game at first, as there may be things you don't understand, or things you would appreciate more if you played through the original Persona 5, such as the characters. That's to say though, the developers for this game did say you can enjoy the game even if you didn't play the original Persona 5, so knock yourself out. Overall though, story's great.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "content": "It was probably wrong to jump into this game as my first Persona game in terms of story, (second JRPG I've ever touched) but I found that I was able to somewhat pick up things fairly quickly from wherever it was left off from whichever the last game was. As someone who is brand new to the Persona franchise, this game was a blast to play, and the story while I thought it wasn't something that was 'out there' and a 10/10, the music is incredible, and bond that the cast of characters share and their interactions with each other, really kept me playing.\n\nAll of the characters are likeable in their own ways, and while the dialogue does get a tad corny every now and then, it's just a bunch of people who are just having a great time on their Summer road trip. What's not to like about it? Sometimes it does get a bit old with the same repeated lines when you're exploring the Jails, but other than that, the cast ranging from the 'problem student' Ryuji, to the dad of the group and cop Zenkichi, hell even Ichinose, even when she doesn't get as much screen time, they are all great.\n\nThe story was pretty decent, while I won't spoil anything here, the character development of some of the cast, was super satisfying. Although, the plot twist or two while it did have an impact, I did see them coming from a mile away. Overall, the story is still definitely memorable, and something that Hardcore Persona fans and brand new players like me would have a great time with.\n\nThe combat is fast and frantic. The gameplay is slick and some of the animations are super cool. Of course, each character has their strengths and weaknesses, while the game obviously isn't just going to let you go through the story like a breeze, if you don't play with these strengths and weaknesses in mind, even on normal difficulty which is what I played at, you will be punished more than you think you will, and I like that challenge. I do recommend that you play on hard difficulty however, and I probably should've done so from the beginning, because one you get your all your Personas kitted out with a wide range of abilities, buffs and debuffs, hitting those weaknesses really does a number on enemies and makes some sections a bit too easy. \n\nThe soundtrack is absolute banger, which is a bit of a shame, since some of the best tracks are behind the combat encounters, and like I pointed out just then, the fights can be very quick. When you do get to those longer encounters, the music, combined with the slick gameplay is bliss.\n\nIf you already are a fan of the franchise, I can probably see you buying this game full price upfront. But if you're like me who was debating whether to do the same or not, I'd still recommend a buy, but when this game does get a discount, I would highly recommend that you buy it immediately. The art direction of the game is top notch, the gameplay is excellent, the story definitely has its moments, and the cast of characters is awesome. If the previous Persona games would now get a PC port, even with its difference in gameplay, I would throw money at you ATLUS and SEGA.\n\nZenkichi best boomer/10",

I enjoyed meeting all the characters again and seeing where they left off. That's about it. All this game does for me is make me want to play the original game. I really wanted to like this game, but i couldn't bring myself to really truly enjoy it. Which is a shame cause I really love this franchise. If you do decide to give it a go, do yourself a favor and use controller. The keyboard controls are horrendous, genuinely a thing of nightmares. Overall: 4/10 \n\nNot really my cup of tea ;n;",

        "content": "Probably one of the most fun Persona experiences thus far. I got into the Persona series very late as I only started when Persona 5 first came out. I love this series, the game play feels fun and refreshing compared to some other turn based RPGs I have played in the past, the social links help you build a really big emotional attachment to the characters in the game, and even the story in amazing. Now about Strikers, it takes all of that and simplifies some aspects but makes others lots of fun. Strikers still has an amazing and compelling story just like Persona 5 and 4... is it predictable, a little bit, BUT I think that is okay as the story is really just there to have a base for the AMAZING game play that Strikers has. If you always wanted to try a Persona game but could never get into because you thought there was too much out of combat time the boy do I recommend this game.",

        "content": "I have about 10 friends who have this on their wishlist, which reminds me that I should say, this is NOT Persona 5. This is sequel to the original, faithful in every way EXCEPT that it has a completely different mode of gameplay. It resembles Musou's, if you've played Dynasty Warriors OR Hyrule Warriors, you should know pretty quickly what you're getting into. I'm not a Fighting game man but you're gonna have to remember some button inputs.\n\nShould edit this as I go on. Initial impressions are good, except what in the hell are these keyboard bindings. The main character and Makoto are the only ones without free aiming, just why!?! If you're gonna play this with keyboard and mouse, I think an extra button or two on your mouse will help you out. if you have good reflexes, get the Level 1 Avenger skill (Not available initially), with which you can nullify an attack if you Phanton Dash towards that enemy at the perfect time; I tell you this as it brought me the most joy out of the combat in the game.\n\nI suffer slowdowns after a few battles, and had to reset the game. Later I found out it's caused by the Rendering Scale option. You also have to tab out of the game and come back for the slowdowns to go off or for the Rendering Scale option to apply. I change back to 1.3 Scale if I know there won't be battles for a while so it doesn't look so jagged (You cannot change this option in the middle of battle so don't plan to do it in the middle of the dungeon's boss fight before an hour of unpausable story!)\n\nAtlus, if you're not going to port the original Persona 5 OR Royal (The extended version) just yet, at the very least make your other releases up to par (Tip: Don't look up anything about the game if you wanna avoid spoilers, seriously, Youtube reviews should suffice, avoid comments or even Community Hub content).\n\nYou might want this mod, the letterbox border is just terrible, it looks like a bug: https://gamebanana.com/mods/288445",

        "content": "I've got this game imported from Japan after a month it came out in Japan. So around March of 2020, both on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4. Beat them both which was nice, if you are expecting similar gameplay to Persona 5 or Royal then you are mistaken, this game has similar gameplay as Hyrule Warriors(That's the first game that popped in my head) As a spinoff (I know some people consider this game as a sequel but I don't really) Scramble, I won't be mentioning it as \"Strikers\", I'll be mentioning it as Scramble since it was called that in Japan. If you think you gonna see characters from Royal in this game, I'm sorry to say but they aren't in it. The story in this game is somewhat alright, I do like in some aspects and some I don't but I won't mention anything due to spoilers and I don't want to spoil anything. The gameplay is pretty alright kinda just stiffy imo, but once you get used to it, you can play it. One thing I would like to complain about is the fusion system, it's feels off like extremely but I think it's just me. Overall I give this game a 7.5/10, it's good for a spinoff but compare to the other Persona spinoffs. It isn't that good in some degree, the only thing I do like is the animation and the story.",

        "content": "persona 5 royal is my favorite game of all time. i even cried when i beat it, absolutely incredible. this abomination of a game is a waste of money and if i had to force myself to beat it: following reasons\n\nthe gameplay is incredibly unfun, the \"jails\" (which is a glorified name for palaces in p5) are unbelievably repetitive, have no flavor, and are reskins of the current city you are in (which is not impressive looking either). the fun part of palaces other than the scenery was that you could do puzzles and explore around. in this game, neither of those exist as everything is a copy and paste of each other and there is 0 fun interaction whatsoever.\n\nthe combat is super SUPER horrible. i really enjoy hard games. i loved dark souls 3 and i have beaten every kingdom hearts game on lvl 1 critical. challenge is NOT an issue. unfortunately, this games combat is lackluster at best but the issue is that there is a fight LITERALLY (i promise i am not exaggerating) every 5 seconds (sometimes less) of walking in this game. if you don't fight youll get behind on levels,  so it's all around bad. not only this, the \"difficulty\" is not actual difficulty, it's just numbers being changed, the attacks aren't any harder to dodge or have any different logic like a harder mode would in another game, it's literally just more health and you deal less damage. this was so horrible and unfun that once i got to the third dungeon i modified the game to one shot every enemy and ignore all damage just so i could get through the game without ripping my hair out from boredom\n\nif you've played and enjoyed a persona game, you KNOW the stories are absolutely amazing. if you would like to avoid spoilers for persona 3 fes, golden, or royal, or this game itself, skip to the next paragraph. persona 5 royal has one of the best stories i've ever seen, be it a book, a video game, or a movie. the characters were great. in this game you have a copy and paste of shido and a character that has a background like akechi's and has the personality of sojiro, all of the antagonists in the game are just rehashed and watered down versions from the previous game. remember kamoshida? the first palace in this game is a girl that takes advantage of men, the second dungeon is a guy who sells writing that isn't actually his... the third dungeon is a cross of okumura and a crappy shido, the fourth is the only actual interesting dungeon that i won't spoil anything for, the fifth has nothing to mention, but the sixth dungeon's antagonist is just a copy and paste of shido and the next one after that is basically mementos and ending the world all over again. nothing in this game is original whatsoever. one of the characters, sophia, is a copy and paste of aigis from persona 3. the only character in this game that i actually liked was the final antagonist, ichinose kuon, had a good personality and ok motive, which is the only reason i liked her, but it was literally just akechi 2.0 and you also could easily tell she would be the antagonist immediately after speaking to her from the first time. the way she was revealed as the antagonist isn't good either. in royal or golden for example you are interacting with the antagonist the whole time and tension is built and you later realize they've been betraying you the whole time, in this game, it's just \"oh, remember kuon from way back when? yeah shes behind this\" it's so unbelievably stupid. also, the final enemy of the game is, \"phones took over everyones lives and we can't think for ourselves now\" literally the dumbest story ever\n\nthe design/look of the game is the only thing i can credit the game on, outside of the dungeons, the game looks absolutely great, despite being terrible in the dungeons. not much to say here\n\nthe music was another strong point. in the persona games. the persona games are the only games i know where the music in them can be good enough to put in playlists with \"real music\", in this game, all of the original songs made specifically for this game are absolute bangers. the only complaint is that any song that received a \"remix\" for scramble that was taken from 5 absolutely sucks in this, because they tried to turn a jazzy thing into rock, and it absolutely sucks.\n\nthe only reason i forced myself to play through this is because i've beaten every persona game and i had to force myself to play this to say i'm fully up with the story in every game and i also spent 70 dollars on it sooooooo\n\nyea don't buy this game",

        "content": "This is an easy recommendation for me. The story can sometimes drag and feel like it's progressing nowhere. At times, the gameplay can feel a little clunky and disjointed. However, ultimately I think these more minor issues can be overlooked in the grand scheme of the game. It was nice to see these characters brought back for another (much shorter) story. \nGetting past these moments where the story can drag is relatively easy, but the gameplay is harder to write off. In my eyes, the original Persona 5 practically perfected JRPG combat, but the Action RPG gameplay on display here is just serviceable. I eventually got used to pausing the action to use persona abilities, but I feel like getting used to this overall hindered my experience with the game. I didn't really have a problem with it, but it's worth noting that this game lacks a confidant system entirely, and the days progress as the story progresses.\nWhile maybe not being quite as good as the original game\u2019s, the soundtrack is very well done. All of the new tracks were really memorable, and remixes of old tracks were too. The opening was great as well.\nThe story starts strong, drags on for a little while, then picks right back up as it climaxes. I think the payoff and experience are well worth putting up with these moments where the story drags. This road trip structure was really enjoyable and held the game together when the story was lacking. If you enjoyed these characters in Persona 5 and thought it\u2019d be fun to go on a road trip with them, then look no further.\n",

        "content": "Recommend getting if you like Persona. P5S is pretty good, a little lacking in story and villain development with sometimes clunky controls.\n\nThis game is basically Atlus's experiment at doing an ARPG, it turned out 'okay'. Camera and lock targeting is pretty lack luster. You have to 'pause' a lot with persona/gun to just get an understanding of what is going on and switching between characters is a little clunky for an modern ARPG. On top of that, the battles are 'instanced' so you lose a little of the open-world-esque that you would expect from an ARPG.\n\nThough you have a calendar like past Personas, the game is a little more free form with the player choices. I actually found the lack of the 'confidant' aspect of character development made it feel pretty empty. Especially since the characters became pretty well developed in P5/P5R and almost none occurred in P5S.",

        "content": "This recommendation comes with some degree of caveat. For those of you looking for a Dynasty Warriors type of game, be prepared for system mechanics that are very unusual to the genre and not super intuitive unless you've played the main branch of Persona games already. For those looking for something similar to the main branch of Persona games, you'll only find bits and pieces of that here, as the gameplay is based around high-speed action rather than turn-based strategy, and things such as Social Links/Confidants and an approach to a day-to-day calender system are not present here. There is still a calender system in this game, but it's much less pronounced since you aren't limited in how much you can do in a single day, and thus there's never really a threat of running out of time.\n\nIf these are things you can work around or if you simply have exposure to both the genre and the Persona series, you'll find a very fun game that manages to combine the systems from both games pretty well. Overall score would be an 8/10 if I had to give it a numerical value.",

        "content": "The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\n\nStrategy\n\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\n\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\n\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\n\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\n\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\n\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\n\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\n\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\n\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\n\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\n\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\n\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\n\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\n\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\n\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\n\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider\u2019s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\n\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\n\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\n\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\n\nA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.",

        "content": "It's very weird to see an entire full-length sequel to Persona 5 with Dynasty Warriors-style action combat, but it's a really cool idea and it's surprisingly well-done! While this game's menu animations aren't quite as immaculate as the original game's, they did a fantastic job carrying over the look of Persona 5 into this engine, to the point where a lot of the time it literally just looks like more of P5, but now running in 60fps. Per Persona tradition, the OST is still absolutely amazing, even in what is essentially a spin-off, and with that classic Warriors-style buttrock flavor appropriately mixed in as well.\n\nThe combat is very interesting at first. While attack combos and switching between characters feels a lot like other recent Warriors games, it still has a LOT of mechanics from P5. Sneaking up on enemies, going in and out of battle encounters, Persona skills, elemental weaknesses, all-out attacks, managing your HP and SP with items, even a lite Confidant system is here. However, much like Warriors games, you are often fighting a LOT of enemies at once, and nothing seems to stop all of them from attacking you at once, with all sorts of different abilities. This makes the combat VERY overwhelming for me, to the point where I definitely prefer Persona games' usual turn-based combat.\n\nAs someone who wasn't particularly impressed by the story and characters in Persona 5, it's kind of hard to get into this game for those same aspects, especially since a lot of it feels like a retread of the original game's plot points anyway. I almost dropped this game entirely since the story is pretty samey in the first few dungeons. Still, if you really like the cast of Persona 5, then you might have a great time with this game.",

I know that the higher ups are (like a lot of Japanese companies) full of fossils who are afraid of PC for some reason, but it is money that the fans would be happy of giving you Atlus.",

I won't speak anything of the story as a. my playtime is low b. youd probably be looking at this from an outsider perspective.\n\nIs P5S worth it? First off, yes. Musou games get really fun once you get the hang of it and all the characters all have unique traits(except Morgana getting a fucking weak 1 damage battering ram move. Not cool Atlus.) and once it gets on a roll, the gameplay gets addicting. First off, the first jail is seriously a chore to get through and it may make it seem like there is nothing else to do. But they made the decision to bar all the side studff until you can get to your next jail.\n\nSecond off, I said it's worth it But only on a sale please. It may have a good gameplay loop but I find this to be a bit... lacking for its current normal price\n\nThird off, you may need to atleast have knowledge of PS's plot to get the story\n\nNext, the music is amazing and absolutely gets you in the mood to straight destroy\n\nThe game also has a semi open world aspect where you get to buy stuff so you can cook or get it ready for use. Also be sure to always talk to your teammates in the non-metaverse map if its a new day. They will usually harbor some loot for you.\n\nUmm... damn writing a long review is hard.",

        "content": "Have you played Persona 5 / Persona 5 Royal? If you said No. Do not buy this game as it is required story wise. \n\nAfter just completing Persona 5 Royal after 140 hours and absolutely loving it for the masterpiece that it is. a True 10/10. I was looking for more and i came upon P5S. Is this game better then Persona 5 Royal? No, Not by a long shot. Is this game worth playing? Yes. The combat does take alot of time to get used to and can be at times annoying. Especially the first half of the game. The bosses tend to be HP sponges and do not be scared to lower the diff. Normal is mostly good. Do not play this game on hard unless you want to suffer. The best part of this game is spending more time with all the characters that you grew to love in Persona 5 and meeting some new ones on the way. The story is solid and there will be some rehashing, related to Royal sem 3. (sem 3 is not cannon in this game). It was nice to travel around Japan and see the different areas as well. Overall i would rate the game a 7.5/10.",

        "content": "P5S, maybe surprisingly, feels like a full and proper sequel to P5 (but, of course, not Royal..). Clocking in at about a 45 hour playthrough for me, it's a bit a good amount more lean than P5 (which took me about 110 hours), and I'm all for it. The social sim half of P5 is now condensed to a lot of screen time with your teammates (as well as building a general Bond meter to get skill points), but the fact that you and the group are ALWAYS together means you don't feel like you're being shorted on social content. The musou-style combat (combined with traditionally Persona-style dungeon exploring) works excellently and, frankly, I liked it way more than the turn-based combat of P5(R). I highly recommend it if you liked P5 and want more time hanging out with the gang.",

Same basic battle system, but here you're able to keep hitting attack in-between all your persona abilities to hit the weak spots and move around a bit. You'll still mainly be relying on hitting weaknesses and then performing all-out attacks. \n\nStory-wise, nothing groundbreaking here. It's just a road-trip romp with all the friends you made in P5 plus a new addition or two. \n\nOverall, if you wanted more adventures from the original P5, then this game is for you!",

It's repetitive/shallow enough that I'll never replay it unlike the main games and the first dungeon is a slog since you don't get the abilities that keep the pace up/add a smidge of combat depth until later but it picks up after that. In other words, worth a playthrough if you're a fan and can stomach some of the early stodginess.",

        "content": "The game's visuals and art style are incredibly amazing, I think it's one of the best that I've seen in the JRPG genre! Not to mention the soundtrack too, especially the battle themes that really get you hyped up slicin' and dicin' through Shadows. Gameplay is extremely fun too, and battles are always action-packed and there is a lot going on at once, and just pure chaos. You just feel like a badass everytime.\n\nThe only downside I can think of so far is the ridiculous number of tutorials that can make it challenging to learn how the game works, especially when about 5 of them pops up in the middle of every battle. As mentioned before - because it's not turn-based like the main Persona games where you can sit back for a bit and take the information in before making a move, battles can be fast-paced and chaotic, and the tutorials kind of ruin the flow of the learning process that you end up feeling overwhelmed with information after.\n\nThat being said, I think the game has a very steep learning curve compared to the other Persona games where you just need to keep on playing to fully understand the vast amount of tutorials you come across. But I highly recommend giving this game a try, overall it is great fun and a fantastic wholesome friendship-simulator game you can get lost into.",

        "content": "tl:dr, combat's bad, story's bad, only bright spot is you get to see the P5 cast again.\n\nYeah I dunno what this \"Musou\" or \"Dynasty Warriors\" thing sparks in people, but it really does not mesh well with Persona's style. When you do an All-out attack or the screen says \"Shows over\" it's supposed to signify telling the enemy \"smell ya later\" in a flashy end to the fight. But here it takes maybe a centimeter off some midboss' interminable health bar? The best thing this game's combat does is make you appreciate how well designed the original P5's combat is. Not many people look or feel good frantically button-mashing into a huge dude. It's just awful; it's awkward, it's long, it's painful, it tests reflexes that you didn't need in P5, and you have to do way more of it than you did before because this is a much more fighty game.\n\nCan't speak for later antagonists, but at least the first one is a complete writeoff. One of the things Persona games do brilliantly is encode a larger theme into the motivation for each foe. P5 is centered around rebellion, so that every boss feels almost cathartic to beat. P5S has, at least so far, just been \"let's beat this person up because they're bad and we're good\". There's no theme to this, and it makes the story feel way less fulfilling. The only thing I'm still here for is more of the main cast, and even then there are no bonding events so the interaction is superficial at best.",

        "content": "I'm not exactly the most professional person to give my opinion obviously, and especially not someone who's played a ton of Persona outside 5 and it's spin-offs. But I'd say that this was an extremely fun experience. The story isn't all that complex or thought provoking and can be a tad generic, or even rehashed from the original at times. But every area has a good message and consistently interesting dialogue between the party members. Like the original, the cast is great. And the two new additions to the crew are very much welcome. Then combat, much like the story, is pretty simple. Many of the mechanics are the same as far as weaknesses, and how buffs affect you and the enemy go. However this time it's put in an entirely different system. Ditching the turn based combat of the Persona series and making it a stylized and unique version of the Dynasty Warriors format. And with that in mind I can concede that it isn't for everyone. But in my personal opinion, the combat is fun, fast paced, and certain battles can genuinely feel grand. Notably the various boss fights. All the animations are very good and stay true to the style. Each character has their own personal tech and that gives them even more diversity than just simply different elements and basic attacks. All the showtime attacks look great as expected, and all out attacks are just as satisfying. I don't even NEED to get started on the music. Every track is just so amazing, and best of all you never have to hear the same track over and over since every battle is randomized. All the remixes are fantastic, and a personal favourite of mine is counterstrike. But on that note, I'll complete this miniature review. I'm yet to play New Game Plus, as I am writing this almost immediately after completing the main story. But I can only assume it'll add some bonus content that add a little more spice into a second playthrough. Thank you for reading, and I hope if you buy this game you enjoy it as much as I.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the summer vacation I never had. It functions as both a spin-off of a spin-off and a direct sequel to Persona 5. Therefore, I would highly recommend playing Persona 5 before diving into Strikers. Also, be sure to bring your PS4 controller for this one, as I felt the frantic combat feels significantly better on a controller.\n\nSpeaking of combat, it amazes me how well the flair and strategy of Persona combat mixes with the frantic, visually-busy Musou combat. The only other Musou game I've played is Hyrule warriors, yet I enjoyed the combat in this game much more. In fact,  it feels more like the combat in FFVII Remake. Button-mashing won't get you far; I had to turn down the difficulty to Easy until I was acclimated with the combat mechanics. Each character and Persona has their own combos, elemental affinities, and spells. Nothing makes me feel more like a badass than mowing down an army of Shadows with the power of friendship and the manifestations of your inner rebel. \n\nMoving on to the story, it parallels much of the narrative drawn in the original Persona 5. Without going into details, I will say that the first couple Jails serve to introduce you to the mechanics and lore of Jails. The monarchs of said jails are just one-and-done antagonists whose hearts you change. After this, the way the story ramps up parallels Persona 5 rather closely. It should be noted that the story is shorter (with regards to Persona standards). However, this is not an issue and I felt the pacing was actually well-done.\n\nMusic in the Persona series is nothing short of exceptional, and Strikers is no different. I did not think it was possible that \"Rivers in the Desert\" or \"Blooming Villain\" could be made any more epic than they already are. Later, you can even customize which songs play during battle.\n\nThe voice acting is stellar, including those of the new characters. Sophia is such sweetheart; her character growth is well written. As for Zenkichi, his character arc draws parallels to Dojima from P4. He and Sophia fit right into the Persona universe, unlike Lana in Hyrule Warriors, who seemed out-of-place.\n\nWith the amount of action going on, the game never dipped in framerate or crashed. One of my favorite changes involves NG+. You get all the characters and equipment from your first playthrough, unlike in P5 where you were limited to certain characters because of the story. It allows for ample time to customize and deck out all the Phantom Thieves with the best gear and moves. \n\nOverall, there is not much I disliked about the game. The damage sponginess of some of the bosses on the harder difficulties is a bit exasperating (and don't get me started on Merciless...). Nevertheless,  this is definitely worth a purchase if you liked Persona 5.",

The game takes the world of Persona 5 and mixes it with Dynasty Warriors to create a repetitive game with an unimpressive story. The best thing about this game existing is that it brings the community ever so slightly closer to a port of Persona 5 coming to PC.",

        "content": "The Gameplay (although kinda gets repetitive just pressing the same two buttons), soundtrack and characters are amazing and it's a huge improvement over the original Persona 5, but here's a couple of things that bother me as I'm still playing the game while I am writing/editing this (long??) review and i hope these could be taken notes for in the future to improve upon:\n\n1. (Issue that connects to the Modern Games)\nThe other battle songs being locked behind a DLC paywall (even though i paid for it so that the main songs wouldn't start getting on my nerves) which was the same issue i had with P5 when i played it years ago because of that.\n\n2. The Calendar doesn't do anything since there's no deadline making returning and that leads to the unecessary issue of  leaving and entering the Jails repetitive for some healing instead of giving the checkpoints some sort of healing station in the dungeons like in the older games since the calendar barely does anything like in 3-5.\n\n3. (Another big Issue that also connects to the Modern games)\nIt's been so many games and spin offs after P2: Eternal Punishment and there still isn't an option to make the Navi shut up, like Rise and Futaba because they're very annoying because their lines get repeated a lot and gets tiring especially Futaba with her very \"quirky and cool\" gaming references with her \"\"\"\"\"crippling social anxiety\"\"\"\" problem when the first Navi did her character better because she's quiet and chill (and that was over 13 years ago with Persona 3 in 2008 on the mf PS2) so i have to mute the Voices entirely during bosses and Normal Combat making the cutscenes afterwards awkward til i finally get to actually open up the menu after 10 million cutscenes bringing my next issue being..\n\n4. That i wish i wasn't bloated with cutscenes that last longer than the gameplay which completely ruins the pace during the jails when the game comes to a stop for just a cutscene of everyone standing still til i can move again, why not have them talk about it in the top right box while i move around, which is an ongoing issue that just gets tiring after the first jail but thankfully there's an option for me to skip cutscenes so I'm glad they put that lol.\n\n4.5. The Second Hot Spring Scene is self-explanatory, just not really all that funny after Persona 3 since that had a fun minigame with it.\n\n5. Why can i not move my camera as i am moving inside of a vent like in P5?\n\n6. Why can i not see my Showtime gauge/bar like how HP, SP and Ammo are shown in the UI instead of hoping to god i get a showtime to do DMG/Knock Down Midbosses that are objectivelly harder than the main bosses\n\n6.5 But it's Okay because nobody bothered to playtest Yusuke because he demolishes literally everything with his two hit combo no matter how strong the boss is to Physical\n\n7. Istg i feel like the AI in this game is how people see the AI in Persona 3 but instead this is worse than that because you don't have a tactics menu to have some control of your party so that you tell what each Party Members does to prioritize for you instead of them going headfirst dive into a modboss/boss and die out of nowhere, or even use their SP for no reason when i don't want them to which connects to my previous second issue, the main healers/support not healing Futaba when i want those character specifically to focus on support.\nIt's a real shame because i'm minding my own business in combat to then just suddenly realize two of my characters died while all of them were together and i'm out of items to revive them back and lose the fight countless times because of it.\n\n8. I don't know if it's because of the hardware I use since i own a Low End Laptop (little bit higher than the minimum requirements) o play games and play it on the lowest settings for it to run good ..but like, to my experience the game tends to softlock in the loading screen a couple of times especially when i go back in the Van so i have to press Alt + F4 to exit the game possibly losing a lot of progress that i haven't saved which is enfuriating since all the progress i made didn't matter because of this\n\nHere's the Positive that i have to say about it for my own experience:\n\nOverall my favourite parts about this game are the Combat (surprisingly after all i said), the two new characters: Sophia and Zenkichi, the Villains are sorta well better written with them having backstories instead of just being evil because they're a \"nasty\" adult and the god dang soundtrack, especially the ones in each area since to me they're overall the strongest part of this game making me not quitting or refunding it entirely, still pretty cool game i recommend a lot, not at full price because this doesn't deserve the $60 tag so get it during a sale\n\n7/10",

        "content": "TL,DR: It's not quite as good as the original game, but it's a spin-off, so what do you expect? The style is much more hack-and-slash and doesn't allow for nearly as much sneakery, but I still like it. I think it's easier than the og game, so if you want a challenge, you'll probably need to turn up the difficulty later on. The story is good, but could have benefited from a little more work. The game keeps crashing for me, and it got more frequent after I updated my computer, but I'm only passable with computers, so I don't know what to attribute that to. It could just be my computer, honestly.\n\nOkay, so I really love the game, because I missed Persona 5 and wanted to play it again but I don't own it (I stayed with my cousin and played it while I was there) but recently, it's been crashing about every hour or so so I updated my computer to see if that would help, and it just made the crashes more frequent. Unfortunately, I'm no computer geek, so I have no idea what's going on or why and no way to figure it out because I'm scared of messing stuff up even more and also because I wouldn't know what I'm looking at. I can't tell if this is an issue with my computer, which is a zephyr gaming computer, I think, so it's fairly beefy compared to my old dell, or if it's an issue with the game. The game itself is very good if you're just looking for more Persona 5 content, but this game isn't in the same, turn-based style of gameplay, so be warned. It's a more of a battle royale with fewer options for sneaking around in the shadows. Personally, I've found it much easier than the original game and have turned it up to the hard difficulty, but I enjoy it nevertheless. I haven't finished the game yet, but I've found the story to be quite interesting. Not nearly as complex and planned out as the original game, mind you, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. I've been playing the game infrequently, so pardon my lapses in memory. The cooking mechanic is interesting, but they don't offer too many sp items for just one party member. There are several for full party, but the coffee beans needed to make Leblanc's coffee are offered very infrequently. I also feel like the areas you stay at get a little boring after a while, because it does take a good amount of time to beat a Jail (which is the Palace substitute. Jails are more for people with trauma who didn't deal with it in healthy ways and didn't get help, I think). Overall, I think it's a pretty good game with an interesting addition to the view of the Persona 5 Metaverse. It could use some work, but perfection isn't real or a healthy expectation to have. It's best enjoyed if you're just looking for something new to play once you've finished with Persona 5 and want a new story in the same universe. It does keep crashing, but I don't know if that's my computer or the game so I can't really comment on that.",

        "content": "First off, you will have to have beaten Persona 5 do its ending to understand this game. And that is not a game for the faint of heart, it requires a significant time investment. But damn, is it worth it. And this game stands on its own as a fantastic sequel and spinoff. It is the first truly great Dynasty-Warriors type spinoff I've ever played. All the others have ranged from bad-mediocre. But this game stands on the shoulders of Persona 5 and has a fantastic combat system, story, music, and characters. Only complaints are that the plot takes a little while to get on its feet, some predictability in the plot, the lack of exp for members not in your party leaving them underleveled whenever you want to change your party setup, and the relative simplicity of the individual characters' movesets when compared to other games of this type. Otherwise, a fantastic game. Totally reccomend.",

The dads in these games are always the best characters, no cap. 9/10, Even though it's a Persona game and frankly this should be par for the course, it was surprisingly lengthy.\n\nedit 1: the game sometimes dropped frames near the end but it was nothing awful.\n\nedit 2: i wish i got the deluxe instead of standard as i would've loved to see the behind the scenes work put into this game, as well as have the phenomenal soundtrack which made at least made me have a lot of frission.",

I hate nothing more than a series that doesn't know when to just move onto its next iteration in the franchise and instead milk a specific portion of it.\n\nEnter Persona 5 Strikers. Bought on sale with an eye roll and wanting to kill some time before the release of Monster Hunter: Rise. I can safely say they did not skimp on the game by any means. More story for the characters you've gotten to know through Persona 5 (excluding Royale), and a great action-oriented game that manages to hold all sorts of wonderful story beats in the future for you.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you liked Persona 5 - give this a shot at least. It's good.",

        "content": "Context: I'm not a big JRPG player though I've played Scarlet Nexus (Kasane playthrough) and Tales of Arise (~50 hours in) and this is my first Persona game as I do not own a PlayStation X. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers is solid fun. The color design and overall aesthetic is exciting and engaging. The story, comic book-like dialogue and animated cut scenes all offer a solid story and presentation. \n\nThe combat difficulty is very fair w/o being brain dead easy and manages to stay just \"fresh\" enough. The ability to play as different party members, use various Peronas, Showtime attacks and so forth keeps the gameplay engaging. \n\nThe stealth mechanic + all out attack has gotten a little old at just 10 hours in. The story, overall game aesthetic and other combat mechanics help carry the game through this weakness.\n\nIf you have not played Persona 5 check out the P5 Plot synopsis on Wikipedia. This will allow you to better understand why the Phantom Thieves don't like the cops, what a Palace is, etc. With that background you will better appreciate the plot and story of P5S.\n\nOverall I give this game an 8/10.",

But the way japanese games keep spewing the same repetitive text for several scenes, it gets kind of ridiculous. \nThe combats fun, but the writing is far weaker than P5 itself. So get it if you dont care about the story. But if you care about the story, expect way more writing where they repeat information several times.",

Being able to play as ANY of the Phantom Thieves was really nice and being able to fight and get battle over quickly but it is still challenging to fight some enemies. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS THAT YOU.NEED.TO.PLAY.WITH.A.CONTROLLER. Otherwise you will be messing with your key binds and it makes it feel very weird to play.

My only complaints with the gameplay were that it played more like a Platinum or Action RPG like the Tales of games instead of a Dynasty Warriors style of game. You're not quite chewing through hordes of grunt enemies effortlessly, but you're also not just focusing combos into a single enemy. It's a hybrid of the two that took a little adjusting to figure out, but the story was quite a trip (pun intended).",

        "content": "this is a far superior game then the original persona 5 or royal's  dating sim that its based on, \n\nyour going to want to swap out your party members since the sp items are not as forgiving as old persona neither is there some full hp and sp recovery thing thats given to you off the bat.\n\nyour gonna be swaping out teams while on the go , so get use to there move set. once all your team mates are low on sp thats perfect time to hop out the dungeon,with no morgana telling you its time to sleep joker  .\n\nsince you can switch out characters your not trusting the main character to be the problem solver for everything , his mainly to help clean out trash mobs and help with mini boss weakness but his not always going to have enough sp to 1 v 1 boss on his own .\n\ndepending on how much money you have you can make simple loop of deleting a high level persona ( letting it go outside the velvet room) to gain xp points for persona you want to focus on .\n\nits got a bit of platforming .\n\nhaving more then one bgm music helps with the grind .\n\nits basically one piece dynasty warriors 1 fused with persona 5.\n\nthe main character choices are still hollow as they where in persona 5 choices  but this game manages to work on them being hollow choice by certain points your dialog will boost your team bonding meter ,this always the thoughtful choices set next 2 choices that are either yes or no or just state the obvious .\n\nunlike in persona 5 , the main dungeon bosses arent just tanks with statues elements and useless stage gimmicks . they are a threat that you need take seriously since there 10 levels above your highest persona . the game will give you a heads up on who to use for the boss fights by simple having that part member interacting with bosses in real life , then you know who else to bring along since persona 5 has techactial element combos  like ice and nuke,fire and wind, fear and psychic . and stage elements that are effective at stopping the boss pattern but might be a 1 time use so you have to be careful (unless your twice as strong as the boss ) \n\nthe arcanas takes a heavy back seat in the game since its not focused on a dating sim but simple these characters spending time with each other .\n\nits best to pace your self with it since your still have to grind with the party .\n\ncharacters state something that said in a cutscenes is actually useful here if you cant play the movies or just want them off.\n\nthey dont hide the best conversions with your team mates on the phone like in persona 5. it simple used as a story based only tool for meeting up .\n\nthe only con are : \n when coming out of battle your in fight mode still, so you have to hide instead of trying to ambush the next enemy whose not interact able until the xp screen goes away. so the enemy could get the jump on you if your not careful .\n\nyour phantom thief actions can some times get confuse if two actions are right next to each other so you have to be careful angel the camera on the one you want .\n\nyou have to pay attention to the range of the ambush button when facing the drone enemies who spawn guards(  you can still get the guards they spawn if you time it right) , it can be bit tricky since height is involved . if you phantom dash action they will see you if there facing too close to your direction.\n\n",

        "content": "An excellent balance between classic Persona gameplay, and hack-and-slash madness.\n\nI'll won't deny in saying that I never actually played the original Persona 5/Royal, having only watched my friend stream the game. But I can still say with certainty that the flair, writing, and characters feel straight out of the main game. While this may be labeled as a \"Spinoff\", it is just as much a true sequel to the original Persona 5. (Not Royal.)\n\nDespite being seen as a \"Warriors\" spinoff of sorts like other series received (Such as Hyrule Warriors or Fire Emblem Warriors), Strikers keeps many of the aspects that make the Warriors games have their flair and charm, while also keeping many story and gameplay aspects that make it feel like a true Persona game as well. The use of skills, weakness exploitation, and even Joker's Wild Card ability are all present, and translated faithfully in the newer hack-and-slash gameplay style. While at the same time still feeling like a dedicated RPG. I'm honestly impressed how well they kept the feel of Persona in the gameplay, not making it feel too alienated as a sequel to P5. (Unlike with my experience with games like Hyrule Warriors, which feels like a Warriors game, but with Zelda characters slapped onto it.) Even so; the gameplay is still very different from regular Persona. It just is faithful in carrying over a lot of signature aspects of the series.\n\nAnd as for the story; I really enjoyed it as well. I won't go into many details, but I can still say for certain that it feels like a natural progression from the ending of Persona 5.\nThe characters all feel the same, they all keep their original voices, and some characters who may have been lacking in P5 got more development and purpose in Strikers. (Primarily with Haru.)\nEven though there are no longer any social aspects in Strikers, the writing and character interactions still feel like what you'd see in regular Persona, albeit a bit more linear. Which honestly; I don't have a problem with.\nI also really enjoyed the new characters added to the game, especially Zenkichi.\n\nAll-in-all, P5 Strikers is a fantastic game, especially if you're a fan of P5 already.\nMy only gripe is that due to being a sequel to P5, you kinda need to see the story of the base game's True Ending to understand a lot of points covered in the story of Strikers. But at the same time; if your there just for the gameplay and not so much the story (Or you just don't mind spoilers), then the game itself has its own content and story to look forward to. Even if you may not pick up on all the references made to the previous game.\n\nEven still; I highly recommend this game. Truly a real treat for me to play this year",

You no longer think that maybe you're under leveled or the fight feels it takes too long. It feels just right and dodges feels great. *Also auto dodges are the shit. Makes everything easy.

Everything except combat is more of the same in a very good way, fresh and new but familiar. \n\nCombat is a whole different beast, and while I thought it was pretty shaky at first, I grew to very much enjoy it a couple of levels in. It's reminiscent of a Dynasty Warriors style brawler, but most fights with masses of enemies are very short. Bosses are considerably more durable, and will mash you if you only swing mindlessly. Personally I blew through the early fights until I hit the first real boss, died enough times in a row that the game recommended I switch to easy difficulty (not happening), and went back to the tutorials to really learn all the mechanics. Started having a blast shortly after that.\n\nCharacters are charming and engaging, but it does have the hallmark cringe perv scenes endemic to anime (not egregious, but in poor taste).",

WTF ATLAS? IT IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME YOU ASSHOLES! you can tell by the graphs that 99% of the reviews were made the day the game was released which means 99% didnt even play the game before making reviews. steam reviews is like a mafia. you only have a voice if you pay in and mob mentality rules. fuck you steam, FUCK YOU ATLAS AND FUCK YOU DENUVO!",

        "content": "Atlus knows how to milk a franchise really well. Instead of creating dairy products that becomes expired even before they are shipped, they ensure that all of their cows are in good health alongside carrying out daily inspections and QC procedures on their machines before doing anything. Almost every single one of their spin offs are made with love and care. \n\nThat includes Persona 5 Strikers. The turn-based + musou hybrid is what I would like to see in future musou games. Although the combos provided for each character are less varied, it does not overstay its welcome as they are also numerous persona skills that we can use to defeat a horde of enemies. On top of that, by utilizing the baton pass from P5, we can control 4 different characters in a single map. Something that most musou titles lack. In addition, the game includes two new playable characters. An AI girl named Sophia and another one which I am not going to mention the name to avoid spoiler territory. Trust me, they fit so well in the phantom thieves gang and each of them will receive their own spotlights they deserve. \n\nAN IMPORTANT NOTE: \n\nDo not play this game, if you have not yet play the mainline game or at least watch a walkthrough on youtube. Bits of the plot from P5 will be mentioned a few times so proceed with caution. \n\nIf you love persona 5, then you will surely going to like strikers as well, Don't let the musou tag turn you off, the combat feels natural and not overly repetitive like the traditional musou games. Of course, it depends on peoples' preferences at the end of the day. As expected from Atlus, their remarkable assortment of musical pieces are unique, memorable and well-composed as always. For those who want a fairly lengthy JRPG, then persona 5 strikers is perfect for you too judging by the total amount of hours I spent to complete all 50 side quests which will appear as an achievement if you manage to unlock it + beating the main story. \n\n*CUTE AI GIRL GO BRRR*\n",

        "content": "This is definitely for fans of Persona 5. The Musou style combat takes a lot of getting used to, weather or not you're accustomed to Dynasty Warriors or not, it's pretty different, and I had to change the difficulty to Easy until I got the hang of things and then reset it to Normal. \n\nIt has some clunkiness, but the story will keep you going if you liked P5. This is a direct sequel, so definitely play this for the story if nothing else.\n\nBeing an action game, you control each Phantom Thief individually, and can freely switch between them. they all fight quite differently and have their own combos/specials, and you'll most likely find one or two that you like and stick with them for most of the game.\n\nYou still obtain Personas and Joker can equip/fuse them etc in the Velvet room. But with so many characters to play as (8 other than Joker) I barely found any use in directly controlling Joker. Why use a fire based Persona when Ann can already use fire spells and use her fire whip moves that cost no SP? And same with each other Phantom Thief with their respective elemental spells. It made sense in a turn-based RPG like the original  P5, but here you can just hack/slash/spell cast to your hearts content.\n\nAll in all a fun, mindless game that honestly needs tweaking in the combat department, but I'd still recommend this to fans of P5 for the story, and to see these beloved characters return in a new setting.",

        "content": "It's hard to say this as Persona 5 and Persona 4 are some of my favourite games of all time, but this game has some below average gameplay. Boss fights can drag on and fights with random enemies are either frustrating or too easy. It seems like I spend most of my time spamming shoot rather than pulling off combos and using magic because enemies do too much damage. SP is much better spent using healing spells rather than elemental or buff / debuff spells because damage is so high. You can use other characters, but why would you when Joker is the best one to be using. Maybe it's because is just came off playing the One Piece Pirate Warriors series but the lack of variety during combat drags this game down. Usually your combo is 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,1,1,1,2,2 (1 being a light attack and 2 being a heavy attack), because those combos use your equipped persona's element (which means you don't have to spend precious SP on offensive magic to hit weaknesses). \n\nThe Velvet Room and persona fusion are cut down and almost a waste of time in this game. You cannot just fuse any two personas anymore. There are set combinations you can use. This is sad because this is what originally drew me to the Persona series in the first place. \n\nHowever, combat and the Velvet Room are the only bad things about this game. Just like Persona 5, the UI and design elements to this game are fantastic. Seeing your equipped persona in the bottom left of the screen always looks cool because there is a unique portrait there for every persona. Menu transitions don't get in the way too much and are worth the time they use. \n\nThe main characters are just as I knew them in Persona 5 (with the disappointing lack of Dr. Maruki and Sumi from the Royal version of the game). Yusuke still makes me laugh. Ryuji is still endearingly dumb. Haru gets more screen time (thank god) and Makoto is still best girl. The new characters Sophia and Mr. Bloodborne (forgot his actual name) are lovely and fit in very well with the main group, with Sophia genuinely being my fourth favourite character (behind Yusuke, Makoto and Haru).\n\nTake this review lightly, as I've only beaten the 2nd Palace and I'm working through the 3rd one right now. I just wanted to write down my feelings on this game so far.",

The action gameplay is decent and very stylish. The presentation, variety, and story content is just as good as P5 but with a less serious and slightly more comedic tone.",

The antagonists are really lame and don't really give you a drive to keep playing and along with your party members they feel like an after thought when side quests you do for them don't really make any social link event happen. Combat will also get too repetitive because it just becomes X and Y through the entire game with occasional oh maybe I will actually manually use my Persona's skills. All I can say is get it on sale",

        "content": "Absolutely worth it, the continuation of the series after persona 5 is incredible to see instead of just some random reboot or remake. Maybe not cannon(not entirely sure) but is perfected in so many ways similar to persona 5, and there are rarely any moments in the game where you are not feeling happy or accomplished within its difficult tasks. Its a wonderful game. And I would love to see maybe just 1 more game like it as another continuation, but possibly similar to persona 3? Not sure exactly but I would love to give some pointers to the developers and share opinions and ideas! But seriously, love the work and the innovations made inside, especially the 3D battlefield and Impossible mode, with the reaper and more! All the challenges are worth beating and playing because it feels nothing but rewarding and fun with the characters dialogue!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an excellent spin-off of Persona 5 and an overall fantastic Musou game. Based on vanilla P5, it leaves out  the new stories from Royal. It's unfortunate, but the new ideas they bring are really great, one of the new characters is really compelling and an excellent addition to the cast. It's definitely a game I'd recommend to anyone who enjoyed Persona 5. It's a fun continuation with a good story and the Phantom Thieves hanging out and travelling across Japan. This might seem obvious, but if you weren't a fan of P5 then this game won't do much for you. Long stretches of cutscenes and characters the game expects you to be familiar with won't be too appealing if you haven't been sucked into the world of P5. Only other major complaint is the post-game, or lack thereof. It's disappointing, especially for a Musou game that can usually have you spend over 100 hours trying to complete the various missions. \n\nOverall though, like I said, Persona 5 Strikers is an excellent game and one that any fan of Persona 5 should play.",

The characters were all very likable and made you want to spend as much time with them doing meaningless shenanigans with them and wishing you could have had more of them at the end of the game which is what strikers manages manages give you in spades as the game is essentially you and your mates go on a road trip and just get into random shenanigans which is just generally enjoyable.\n\nAlong with that this game's combat system is one that manages to be very fast paced and mobile while still maintaining the style and feel that p5 had, overall being honestly more enjoyable to spend time with as it manages not to get repetitive overtime and maintains the vibrant and fast paced feel that it has when you first experience it which is all enhanced by the soundtrack that fits the the designs of the areas they accompany or make you feel invincible as you go through waves of enemies.\n\nAll and all I had a blast with this game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pick it up.",

Additionally, since the game takes place on the road over a short time period with characters you already know, the time management and social links have been replaced by bond skills, which are much simpler and a bit less satisfying. Despite these huge changes to the formula, [i]Strikers[/i] manages to strongly hold on to it's [i]Persona[/i] identity. [i]Persona 5 Strikers[/i] is both a worthy sequel and a blast in it's own right, and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who enjoyed P5, and probably to any hack'n'slash/jrpg/arpg fans too. Now if only it's predecessor was available on PC...",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is like what Age of Calamity was for Breath of the Wild: A must-have experience for fans\n\nThe whole game feels more like a Persona game than a Warriors one, and the mechanics that Persona fans are familiar with, such as fusing, were greatly improved from even Persona 5 Royal. The things that were changed and made to be different to reflect upon its direction, such as the combat, is incredibly fun, rewards skill, and is something I found myself enjoying over the original turn-based formula that the Persona series is known for.\n\nIf you're looking for a less time-consuming Persona experience with a greater development into its combat than with time management around tasks and social links, then this should be up your alley. Despite the feeling of being a Persona-lite title, its gameplay loop is meaty and offers an incentive for fighting battles for stat boosters and a constant means of getting stronger. I'm playing NG+ on the hardest difficulty, and it's still feeling adequately challenging enough to keep me on my toes despite having Personas that would make the previous games into a laughing stock.\n\nIf you're unsure about getting it at full price, then be sure to pick it up when it's on a sale. You won't regret it. The Digital Deluxe Edition is worth it for the little extras especially the legacy BGM tracks.",

Mostly it will just be references to the original story won't make sense but doesn't keep you from following this ones story. It will spoil it though obviously so if you don't want that I would play 5 first. \n\nAlso the game play is completely different from the main line Persona games being made by Koei and if you played one of their games then that is what it plays like, combo beat up with summoning personas. All around I found it fun.",

A chance to see what happens after the events of the main game and an opportunity to go on another mission that expands the wold of the original. The new battle system is top-notch, and resembles the action-oriented battles of Final Fantasy VII Remake. Honestly, I would love if Persona 6 had a more refined version of the battle system in this game. It is so much fun to see the Phantom Thieves move about as they do in the cutscenes of the original game, but this time you're in control. The fusion system has been further simplified in service of removing many hard annoyances, but with the tradeoff of reduced Persona count. I would love to see a sequel to this game with a few small things changed, but as it stands I can heartily recommend this entry.",

It's no longer a JRPG or a social simulator, as it's all to do with a Warriors-like game and does it perfectly. The personas being incorporated into battle and having a different layout for each Jail is amazing, as well as the story and character interactions being perfect.",

The combat system is actually one of my favorites that I've seen, it's not drastically complex or too simple for my liking. I love the interactions that the Phantom Thieves have in this game, and it's such a joy to get to see them be the goofball group of friends that they are. The story is nice, the visuals are stunning, the music certainly speaks for itself, overall Strikers is a blast that I think speaks for itself. Although it may not be as grand or exciting as its predecessor, I think the experience Strikers offers more than speaks for itself.",

Although AI in this game is already some of the better ones that I've seen, your teammates can still act like buffoons and get killed constantly by easily dodgeable attacks.\n\noverall great game. The highlight of this game for me is gameplay, dungeon exploration and fight management (and music of course). Don't expect a great story and you'll enjoy this game a lot.\n",

        "content": "A very impressive and unique to the incredibly popular Persona 5. Initially seeing that it was being developed by Omega Force kinda put me on guard as I've never been a big fan of the Warriors series of games, but I was still curious. Turns out that this is probably my favorite of their games. Gameplay is a surprising blend of those Warrior games (fight huge swathes of enemies who might throw in a few hits here and there) and Persona's weakness/resistance system. You have your basic combos that develop as you play each of the characters and you can bust out their Persona to do attacks that enemies are susceptible to, to knock 'em down and do an ALL OUT ATTACK that does huge damage to every enemy around. Each character has their own combo strings and variants that they learn as you play as them, so each one feels unique to each other, so try each one and they might fit your play style better than another, aside from worrying about weaknesses.\n\nPresentation is great, aside from some minor jagged edge problems that you can fix if you look up how (I've forgotten how exactly, it's been a while, but it also made everything else a tad funky). The stylization of characters and the world is still spot on to Persona 5 (no surprise), runs mostly well and of course the music is still S-tier at worst. You'll definitely have new favorites after playing through this.\n\nThe story and new characters are also pretty solid! I love both Sophie and Zenkichi, they're colorful additions that don't feel out of place with the core cast at all. They're well fleshed-out on top of the main P5 cast getting some more time that they hadn't before and also allowed for some more interactions among each of them. Only issue is that some of the villains of each new zone you get to explore aren't as fleshed out. One being familiar with a teammate and you don't really get much more than \"I thought you were good before, but now this happened and you're bad.\" to \"Ah, sorry about the sudden bad. We cool now?\" and then you leave. I mean you learn more than that, obviously, but it doesn't hit as strongly as some other characters developments. And those who played any spinoffs or the Royal version: it's focused on Persona 5. Old character portraits are used as opposed to the refreshed ones in Royal, Sumi doesn't exist in this timeline and neither does all the Royal specific changes to the story. Gonna miss Sumi, she was great and hope they push her in likely spinoffs, along with Zenkichi and Sophie but we'll see as unlikely as it is.\n\nAll in all, absolutely loved this game so much so I 100% it. A bit easier to do than core Persona 5, and on par with Persona 5 Royal. If you've played Persona 5 and loved it, absolutely hop onto this game. If you've played Persona 5 Royal and loved that, you'll be a bit saddened or confused, if that's the only version you played. Either way, it's excellent!\n\n(PS, IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING: RYUJI IS A POWERHOUSE, UTILIZE PLAYING AS HIM.)",

This might be the entry persona game for players that dont like turn based rpgs but are curious about the persona subverse. Still as an avid Turn based rpg lover I think the pauses for menus and skill usage makes this game keep the charm of turn based rpgs while using action combat. Id give this game a 8 out of 10 as of now.",

        "content": "Nominated this game for the \"Best Soundtrack\" award which it totally deserves.\nother than that the game is undeniably fun :\n\nthe dungeon/metaverse sections are the heart of the experience, Omega Force and P-Studios translated the original turn based combat into a musou style game pretty well :\n+the fighting mechanics are implemented perfectly, combat feels fast and fluid while it still feels like a persona game. \n+ploughing through a large number of enemies is fun.\n+there are a lot of custom hit combos and animations for the different personas you gather.\n+there are weak points for the enemies just like the original game and executing them in a hack n slash manner feels satisfying. so you'll have to pick your party based on the enemy types in that dungeon.\n+you can also pick between all of the phantom thieves, each one with their own combo set and fighting style (some better than the others) so the combat is pretty deep.\n+world traversal (although a bit restricted) is pretty fun too. stealth is still in the game.\n(+/-?)some people complained on the lack of a calendar system like the original game and that you can exit the dungeons whenever you like without passing the day (which was a penalty and a risk you'd have to take in the original) but I think its fine, although it makes the game a bit easier, its still challenging in some places; like when you're locked in the metaverse for story related reasons.\n\nso if you are a fan of Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal or just love hack 'n slash games in general, you'll definitely enjoy playing this one.\n\nother than that the social part of the gameplay is a bit butchered compared to the original P5 but its fine for the context of the game. the over-world gameplay is fine too, you have to sometimes gather info from the NPCs and maybe buy a couple of stuff for the dungeons.\n\none problem i had with persona 5 strikers was the padding in certain areas of it. there are side missions (Requests) but most of them are added just for padding the playtime (although the game is pretty long itself). the Requests aren't that different to the main game, they are mostly fetch quests for an specific item or \"kill x number of enemies\" or even \"replay a boss\" a couple of times and etc... but the rewards are worth it. although i must add that for some side quests you'll spend a bit of time with the others members which is always great to see in the story.\n\nsome other stuff that annoyed me are the following :\n-the grind for the BOND points at the end of the game was boring, went through half of the merciless NG+ mode to complete it for 100%.\n-it takes a long time to beat [b]some[/b] bosses/elites, you'll just have to spam the weak point for a couple of minutes. without much else to do.\n-2 out of the 8 dungeons feel short and half-assed ([spoiler] Okinawa and Kyoto to be specific [/spoiler]), they make sense story wised but I preferred the longer and larger dungeons.\n\nthe story is a direct sequel to the original P5, so unless you played it or watched the anime you wont understand most of the rules here, cause they aren't explained that much.\nthe story it-self is good and the new characters are written pretty well. \nyou can still pick between multiple dialogue options but they all lead to the same result and there aren't different endings like there was in the original game; this can be good or bad based on the person playing it. for me it was fine, cause it wasn't forcing me to lookup responses and pick the one that led to the better ending, I just picked the goofy options that I liked.\n\nthe game is still stylized like the other persona games and will age well for years to come but swapping between different Menu pages (like the inventory ,etc.) has become a bit slower, (they added longer transition animations to them) which you'll get used to it after a while.\n\ni'll say it again, if you are a fan of Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal or just love hack 'n slash games in general, you'll definitely enjoy playing this one, cause i did.\n8/10",

The game have some a the greatest soundtrack in a Persona game I have the chances to listen too, they really capture the essence of Persona 5 and brought it forward in this one.\n\nIt's also a Great Musou type game which I honestly don't play a lot of but still manage to have fun while playing so. The combination of easy control, fast-paced gameplay,flashy combos and finisher really make the game enjoyable. Well at least for me a Persona fan.\n\nAll and all this is just a nice Musou type game with P5 aesthetic slap on top of it, I can guaranteed that you will have fun playing this game.",

        "content": "Oozing with the same chic personality and heartfelt cast of Persona 5; Strikers is a refreshing take on the musou genre. It's got a killer soundtrack with a mix of original music and remixed pieces from Persona 5. The amount of locations you are able to explore and the detail put into them are astounding. It really captures how one might feel walking around and the vibe the city gives off. The combat will feel familiar to veterans of the musou genre, but remains engaging and fluid with the inclusion of the element mechanic from Persona; encouraging players to switch characters mid-fight to deal extra damage or take reduced damage.  \n\nSadly only members of the phantom thieves (and new characters) are present throughout the game and the confidant system was not included. The story is nothing to write home about, but does give more insight into the world of Persona. On higher difficulties, grinding is critical and a mastery of the mechanics of the game is a must for the player to advance. The game also feels unpolished in some parts, such as the consistency of the audio quality of the voice acting and some cutscenes. \n\nTL;DR It's a tourism ad campaign for Japan.",

        "content": "Let's be real, it's Persona 5. Anyone who knows me knows I love this installation in the series, and to have a direct sequel to the events of the game is just quite golden. I'm not nearly done with the game, but I've got enough time here to say that I'm pleased with how well this was made.\n\nI never expected that nearly every aspect of the game would be improved upon. The story is rich and drives in more development for the characters, songs have either been remixed and remastered to fit the action style (and nearly all of the new songs added are complete bops), and the style seen in P5 has been expanded upon and grown to a massive scale.\n\nThere are only a couple gripes I have. Very minor, but as it affects the gameplay itself, it feels rather sad to mention. I play this game for the story and music, but the gameplay was never all that engaging to me. Each of the fights had meperforming the same tactics, only changed by which boss I was going to face next. The bosses in this game are juggernauts, and it feels like they were only padded out just so that the in-fight dialogue could be heard. It just felt like there was too much health, and sometimes there were some really messed up moments between the AI and the bosses that just left you with almost nothing you could do (Hyodo without any tables left is a notable jerk that's for sure).\n\nOverall I enjoyed it, though. Still trying to get through merciless mode, which is its own can of worms, but I still quite enjoy it.",

        "content": "P5S is a fun follow-up to P5/P5R in the form of a 3D beat-em-up. Giant waves of enemies come at you and there's occasionally a boss who does big damage yet can be stunned for your own big damage if you hit it's weakness enough. Sounds like Persona/SMT gameplay in an action environment? You'd be correct.\n\nThere's balance issues with characters strengths and weaknesses but it never forces you into a unwinnable situation; plus the balance between Persona elements and beat-em-up elements was more important and they succeeded there. You have to keep an eye on your skills mostly for stronger enemies and to improve combos but if you're exceedingly talented at these kinds of games you could ignore it...but the system is fun so there's no reason to. The story is a bit shallow with our returning cast while the new faces (at least the good guys) get character development that's pretty logical and nice, but it probably won't leave the biggest impression on you. It's moreso a reason to see Ren, Ryuji, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba etc. again and get what would be confidant cut-scenes in P5 but stretched through the whole game. The game is  gorgeous and despite it being frantic I would stop after clearing an area to look around. I was worried when the characters looked a little off when it was revealed but they look fine in-game alongside the demons and levels you'll explore.\n\nIt's a fun sequel that doesn't push the envelope outside of introducing RPG menus and abilities to Samurai Warriors like gameplay. If you like Persona 5 it's a great. simple and significantly shorter. It allows extra time with the Phantom Thieves too, especially Haru! and don't worry - one thief won't take up a ton of the main plot this time. Makoto, I'm staring lazers at you. Gameplay design also feels similar despite the new combat style as managing your abilities before heading into a jail is where the real challenge comes in and then using those abilities sparingly. It's fun and enjoyable, do consider getting it!\n\nIf you don't like P5...you'll think it's pretty I guess. It's another warriors game with the ability to do an attack from a menu that does more damage. I do think unless you are *really* into the game's art style, you could do better with other games on Steam.",

I wouldn't even call this a spin-off but this is a true sequel in my books.\n\nThe games \"social\" system might not be as deep as in the original game but for what it's worth it does its job well letting you do optional quests for your companions and encounter in optional dialouge during your spare time and you'll be constantly interacting with you companions throughout the story.\n\nIf you have played the original Persona 5 Game this is a must play. A true masterpiece with a deep plot and good mechanics\n\noverview:\n+ Deep and well crafted engaging plot that is simply outstanding\n+ Combat is very fun and at times very engaging\n+ Persona Creation and modification feature is well crafted and goes as deep as you're willing to go\n+ Atmosphere and environments are outstanding\n+ soundtrack is excellent\n+ Character encounters throughout the game are enchanting and deep",

The action is supposed to be fun, but i never did like the Dynasty Warrior format - and while this isn't quite as endlessly horde-wavish, there's still a bit too much going on when spamming buttons.  I miss the pace of the RPG, and maybe I haven't really given the game system enough of a chance, yet.  Art/music is spot on - but I'll need to sit down and just play it thru a bit more - and maybe I'll be able to love it, too.",

        "content": "\"iT's SMT WiThOuT tHe hEaRt aND a DaSh oF dYnAsTy wArRiOrS.\" - IGN 2021.\n\nThe story/setting:\nThis game continues the story line from the original Persona 5 ending. It follows Joker and the Phantom Thieves as they traverse around Japan during their summer vacation with many exciting locales and palaces (jails) to explore and fight through! Anyone who has played the previous titles (P5/P5R) will understand many of the references made in this title.\n\nGameplay:\nCombat has been changed from turn based to a more dynasty warriors-esque 1 vs 100 type deal but still having the familiar persona combat system implemented in its RPG predecessor. Each member of the phantom thieves have their own unique persona to level up and as well as melee combos to learn which can be quite satisfying. Being able to see each member of the phantom thieves in combat fighting shadows alongside Joker is quite pleasing. Each individual character have a \"show-time\" ability that is built up through combat and it acts as a ultimate skill from each character's specific personas.\n\nWhile it took a little time to get used to, using personas in combat can be quite hectic since combat quite fast paced and would be more difficult if not for the time freeze when aiming skills over an area of enemies. Anyone who has played previous Persona or SMT titles will be familiar with the weakness system. Additionally fusion of personas (or  demons) returns again in this title with a more simplified system than it's predecessors.\n\nRPG elements:\nA lot of the social interactions between individual characters have been stripped out, in favor of a bond system that levels up and gives points for you to allocate into improving the phantom thieves team abilities as a whole. While there are still group events and small hang out events between characters that give you bond points and additional rewards for completing them all of the romance and dating systems in the main line games have been completely removed.\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a perfectly balanced game that takes the RPG elements of its predecessors and implements it well into a dynasty warriors type of game. While I do wish that social links were still a part of this game, the gameplay and story will easily keep any persona/SMT fan entertained for over 70 - 80 hours long depending on how much of a completionist you are.",

I usually hate musou shit, but this one is pretty fun. The combat is neat and i really enjoyed the way you use your personas powers in real time with combos to counter enemy weaknesses, just like the turn-based game.\n\nAnyway, Strikers is a worthy sequel.

        "content": "Kinda a disappointment. They hyped this game up so much, slapped on a $60 price tag, and then BAM, letdown. I really like the Persona series, but this game just didn't do it for me. The story was boring, the cities were empty with nothing to do, the gameplay was just a warriors game. I spent not even 35 hours playing the game and when I was playing it I just wasn't really enjoying it. The soundtrack is the one thing that I don't have any issue with, its pretty good. But if you really like the Persona series, sure go ahead and buy it. And if its on sale for like $30 or under then sure, go ahead and buy it. But like man I was expecting so much more from the game because of all the advertising and hype it got. The main thing I wish it had done was added stuff to do in the cities, like mainline Persona games have done.",

The story is alright, but the characters are a bit one-note and often feel more like tropes than characters. It's hard to explain, but I've been playing on and off since launch and still haven't finished. I just haven't had the desire to play. The game runs pretty good, although it is locked at 60FPS. \n\nIf you like warriors games, definitely pick it up. Otherwise I'd wait for a good sale. I think 30-40 dollars is good. My only huge complaint is the difficulty. Easy feels way too easy but normal feels a bit too hard- I wish there was something in the middle.",

It is important to note that some fights are way easy even on hard mode because of the area damage that all the attacks do, but as always you cant just simply spam the same, you will run out if stamina, so that keeps the strategic side of the franchise alive, and I'm glad of that. \n\nThe soundtrack is fabulous as always",

        "content": "Excellent game.  It's a really good blend of Persona meets Dynasty Warriors with a little more strategy involved (like having abilities that enemies are weak to will greatly help keep you alive or beat enemies.)\n\nNot only is this game super fun to play, but the story that goes with it is also really good.  The only downside to the story is that some people might be a little lost of what's going on in terms of characters and stories, mainly because this game deals with a time period after Persona 5.  \n\nI would love to see more games exactly like this, or even a sequel to this game.  Just hoping this helps bring Persona 5 to PC so that other people can enjoy that game and relate to this game a little more!",

The combat feels like a fun departure from Persona's turn-based combat while still remaining true to staple mechanics like exploiting weaknesses, One More, and All Out Attacks.\n\nThe story is also very fun, and it's great getting to see all the characters interact with each other. The individual plots for each \"dungeon\" do feel a little samey so far, but that isn't enough to detract from the charm and amazing rapport the Phantom Thieves have with each other.",

        "content": "Anyone familiar with the Warriors games will have a rough understanding of what to expect. But this time around the Persona mechanics are integrated quite well, making it a very different experience than any Warriors game before it - if anything, the much larger number of enemies than normal for a Persona game necessitates a stronger focus on the weakness system in order to maintain an advantage. And yes, Persona collection and fusion are still core mechanics as well. Overall, it lends itself to using very different tactics than a normal Persona game, and combinations I wouldn't have really bothered with outside of this game. The story and cutscenes are completely faithful to what one would expect of Persona, and I felt were very fulfilling.\n\nThat being said, I will say the boss design is a bit weak - the major bosses do have unique mechanics and do feel unique, but the fights drag a bit and begin to feel stale with the amount of hp they have. The minor bosses don't have the benefit of unique mechanics to offset the hp-spongeness.",

I loved it.  \n\nThe game is lengthy.  The mechanics are fluid.  The integrated RPG elements are well done.  The story is great and its wonderful to have the Phantom thieves back together again for a second romp.  The writing is good.  \n\nExcessive chit chat can get a little tiring towards the end of the game.\n\nOverall excellent.",

The Persona elements they incorporate are neat, but not nearly enough to keep me engaged. I don't think it's a bad game so to speak, but I definitely regret paying full price for it.

        "content": "P5S is a sequel/ spinoff of Persona 5, and its pretty good. The question I see about this game all the time is \"do I need to play Base Persona 5 to play this one?\" and yeah, I think you should. It takes place directly after, and while they don't touch on the story of P5 often, you still miss a lot of information on the characters and world, and if you go back to P5 later, a lot of stuff will be spoiled for you. Its not MANDITORY by any means, but enhances the game considerably. \n\nWith that out of the way, the game itself is a hack and slash game similar to the Warriors Series. And this is the first game with that combat I've consistently enjoyed. I've played Fire Emblem Warriors and Hyrule Warriors, and both of them get really REALLY boring after so many hours, but P5S keeps it fresh the whole way through, and is the only of this kind of game I've gone and 100%ed. The Demon Fusion elements from SMT are still present, but have been watered down considerably. This was a downside for me, but if you found the system tedious, this could be a good thing for you. Unless you're going for full completion, there is minimal grinding in this game, and the different ways to improve are all satisfying and fun to keep up with. The social aspect is all gone and the story is very streamlined, which makes it feel a lot less \"persona-y\" and the story is generally far more simple than anything else you'll see in this series, but the game never pretends to be more than it is. If you're coming for a simple button masher with some familiar faces and a cool world. you're in the right spot. But if you want a game that will make you feel the same way previous Persona games did, you're in the wrong spot. Overall if you liked P5 and want more. I'd recommend checking this one out. 6/10",

And when it comes to the Musou the mechanics are pretty bare bones. Which, of course, ain't that bad - But that's a big hit or miss with a ton of people.\n2. There is no story choices. Romance, social links, mini-games? None here, bub.\n3. It's really a story that doesn't need to be told.\n4. The music is bumping.\n\nPersona 5 is great. But this extra filler? Even the most die hard fans I think will be semi-let down over it. For example, Sophia and Old Man Zenkichi are not very charming. Finally, it has some of the lame changes of heart ever... Including someone semi-copying other peoples manga tropes and adding them to his own stupid manga. I would advise you watch a YouTube for about an thirty minutes of gameplay just to see if it's for you.\n\n",

        "content": "This is persona 5 light fused with a mus\u00f4. \n\nFirst, I would strongly recommend coming here after playing the original persona 5 or better persona 5 royal (even though in this case some elements would not be cannon with this story). First, it is a sequel / OVA so starting by the second entry is a bit silly, second a good half of the persona experience is your link with its cast of characters so, even if most of the mechanics of the story are re-explained, you would miss a lot a things, and persona 5 is one of the best games of last generation sooo...\n\nAnyway, presentation wise, exactly like its predecessor, this game is pristine, beautiful, inspired and varied environments, the music (again) is awesome, great animation works... It just radiates quality.\nSame thing in the writing department, the characters are as endearing as ever, and the additions to the thieves are very welcome, but the plot is a tad predictable sometimes.\nThe problem arises in the gameplay department, the moment-to-moment gameplay is clearly an experiment here, sometimes fighting can be tedious because of the stuck camera, lack of clarity, and the amount of enemies / time to dispatch them\u2026 when it\u2019s good it is really good you dodge and weave through the enemies with grace\u2026 until nothing shows you that another enemy is about to one shot from behind\u2026 Also, some jails (think palaces in p5) are a bit too big and revisiting them can be a bit tedious. The fusion system is a bit more tedious with level requirement for fusions components. And for the out of jail part, it is good, the confident system has been replaced by a much simpler system that allows you to unlock bonuses by collecting points doing requests (simple quests), after story event and during fighting, simpler but fitting for this much simpler game.\nAnyway, it is a quality game with some gameplay inconsistencies, though even though it is less good than its mainline entry, I enjoyed it a great deal and if you liked p5 you should too! Though I would really love to see another iteration on these mechanics, a p6s maybe? \nAnyway, it\u2019s time for you to tear your mask out, right?",

The combat is great and the story and characters are amazing and even though i knew nothing about them before this game it made me wish i did. I would definitely get this game if you like RPG's and feel good content.",

That being said even if you haven't had the chance to play the original because its not on pc, this game still stands on its own as a fun game with a compelling story. For a 3D hack and slash style game P5S is middle of the road in terms its combat. The music is amazing with some new music mixed with remixes of some tracks from the original game. This game does however lack a lot of real challenge. If you are someone looking for a game that will challenge you this is probably not a game for you.",

        "content": "If you liked Persona 5 this game is quite a good sequel.  (Playing this without playing Persona 5 will leave you utterly lost though so go play Persona 5 now) \n\nComparatively, you get another 3/4 of a game of Persona 5 story and character interaction.  You get another new 3/4 of a excellent Persona 5 soundtrack and some arranged returning tracks.  All the new battle music is amazing as usual.  Voice acting is top notch.  No social links and the persona and fusion lineup is pared down, but it's no big deal.  \n\nGameplay is decent.  It's a Musou game by the Dynasty Warriors people but does not feel swarmy or button mashy most of the time.  Even on normal difficulty not paying attention to the enemy movements and resistances will get you killed as enemies can hit like trucks.  There's more focus on killing large minibosses over swarms of enemies.  And the big bosses are pretty fun.",

        "content": "Just about everything I loved about both Personas 5 and Royal is transplanted into Strikers. The charming characters, the story, the vibrant menus, and the music combine with a new combat system that disposes of turn-based, RPG-style fighting in favor of a more frenetic, real-time, one vs. 1,000 format that still makes you feel like you\u2019re playing a Persona game.\n\nPut the Phantom Thieves in damn near anything, and I\u2019ll show up. They\u2019re so well-written, realistic-sounding and mature. And they\u2019ve grown from when we last met them, showing empathy to their adversaries. You\u2019ll cheer when they get their big damn hero moment. How could I not take the opportunity to spend another 100 hours with these kids? And on a cross-Japan road trip too? Say less.\n\nIt\u2019s almost unfair to call Strikers a musou game, despite being one, as it doesn\u2019t feel like a Dynasty Warriors game at all. For as much as I love Koei Tecmo\u2019s tentpole action series, Strikers\u2019 combat is too slick and too varied, and too stylistically Persona to be called a typical musou. And I think it\u2019s that combat that saves an otherwise sparsely appointed game.",

There is so much fun tidbits that makes the cast and humor funny. I love the characters, writing, and visuals. The styles and humor makes the whole game colorful for me. I hope Persona 5 royal will come out on PC someday. This game felt like a little fanservice that touched my heart after Persona 5 Royal. Please keep up the great work developers!",

        "content": "[h1] They should have gone all in. [/h1]\n\nThis is a game that exudes adequacy. Everything is where it needs to be in order to sell a game people play and, at the end of their session, say \"wow, that was a unique and interesting game\" without actually paying it any mind. The reality of the situation, however, is a bit more grim.\n\nWe should start by giving this game kudos for TRYING to implement mouse and Keyboard support. For a W-Force product to do this, you know someone else was involved forcing it to happen. No, on to the short and sweet as to why I would not recommend this game:\n\n[b] Replayability is almost nonexistent [/b]\n\nThere's not much more to say. You are trapped in a linear storyline with horribly restrictive and boring free-roam [b] elements. [/b] Outside of that, it is just you doing missions with a main character who, while wildly loved by the series' respective fans, is not the reason people play Warrior games. To have a single-digit number of characters that can be played, and only after some time, in a title like this is embarrassing and really highlights the shortcomings of the rest of the game.\n\n[b] Artistic style is not an excuse for fun. [/b]\n\nAt the end of the day, a fresh coat of paint isn't an excuse for a lack of content. It looks very pretty, yes. True to the series for artistic choice? Yes. Does it add anything else? No. It seems the majority of production on this game went into pressing out another story in the Persona Universe without actually making the game around the new action-based mechanics.\n\nDon't get it unless you merely want to continue the Persona fandom.",

        "content": "It's a sequel with great story and an actual continuation to the original Persona 5's (also great) story, but of course doesn't play like the original game. It is by no means easier either, as the game can be insanely difficult even on Normal mode, making Hard mode almost impossible to complete. Without doing extra side stuff like requests, or secret bosses the game might only take about 20 hours to complete, which my play-through with doing those things (plus some save scumming for specific side objectives) i finished the game at around 35 hours, which is not reflected in my Steam playtime as I was alt-tabbed out of the game a lot. I've not played many Musou games (only two being both Hyrule Warriors spin-offs as well) but for a crowd fighting game it's really weird the most you'll fight at a time is 3-15 enemies, with bigger crowds only available in scripted events, filled with generic no weakness enemies.",

        "content": "An okay Persona spinoff game and a barely passable port. I would prefer to give this a mixed review over a negative review, but people only read the negative reviews.\n\nIf you're buying this, then you have probably already played P5/P5R (and if you haven't, there's really nothing here for you). It's pretty much just a lot of fan service tied together with an okay story, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. The gameplay loop is novel at first if you're coming from the slow, turnbased combat of the mainline games, but gets very boring and repetitive towards the later half of the game. I used Cheat Engine to get more XP and lowered the difficulty because the game expects you to grind to level up all your characters even on the lowest difficulty, which is frankly silly. \n\nThe fanservice is enjoyable, but they cheaped out on a lot of the smaller interactions. For example, in mainline Persona 5, if you ate ramen with Ryuji in your free time, there'd be at least some action-figure-like animations accompanying you eating ramen. In this game, it just gives you a black screen with Ryuji telling you how delicious the ramen is. It's not great, but this is only for the minor interactions and nothing else really reaches that level of laziness.\n\nThat said, if you understand this is just a spinoff with none of the major Persona mechanics and just want to have more time with the Phantom Thieves, this might be worth it- on sale.",

        "content": "TLDR: I don't like the gameplay loop, its too boring and redundant, but I like scenes where the gang hanging out and once the new story start rolling. There's something lacking on the gameplay loop, I find it hard to gather motivation to comeback to this game.\n\nI'm a huge Persona fans so I'm a bit sad I can't like this game, I tried to push the end because I want to see what's the story had to offer. This is not a bad game, its a decent game but I need to push my self to finish it unlike other Persona games.\n\n[h2]Good story and Character[/h2]\nOne of the good aspect in this game is the story, it's not as good as P5 Royal's third semester but it's an enjoyable story. It started with formulaic story but after the monotonous story done, it's an enjoyable story. The new cast on this game is the highlight of this game, his story is good and enjoyable, it had soul and might touch your heart. I really enjoy his story.\n\n[h2]Great Music[/h2]\nI like the soundtrack of this game, my favorite one is \"Daredevil\" and \"Counter Strike\". This game had really good music like you would expect from any persona games. The music gives so much vibe in this game, for example the \"Daredevil\" is feel like \"I'm stylishly unstoppable\" when striking toward towers and \"Counter Strike\" feel like \"a smooth badass\". It's pretty good\n\n[h2]This is a decent game for returning fans, but its not a good game for new comers[/h2]\nThis game contains every team member already finished their character development on P5 so there's no many growth worth mentioning, many stuff in this game will appeal to the fans but might confuse new comer.\n\n[h2] There's a good mechanic, but gameplay wise, I can't say many good thing about it[/h2]\nThere's a good mechanic like allowing you to swap to previously learned skill on your persona and cooking. I'm a huge Persona fans and find this entry quite underwhelming. It's still feel like Persona 5, character and story wise its good but gameplay wise is meh.\n\n[h2]SP & HP management is bad in this game[/h2]\nOne of the most fun challange in Persona game is HP and SP management and this spin off made it a nuisance. On the original game, you need to manage your resource efficiently, if you fail to do so you'll lost 1 day worth of free time it's a pretty clever mechanic. On this spin off there's no penalty, to recover your resource just simply go out and go to dungeon again while doing it you need to watch 3 loading screen, it's such a pain to do. This game should've had 1 button to recover HP & SP instead of doing that stupid clunky way.\n\n[h2]Decent UI, bad UX[/h2]\nI hate the UX in this game. The UI is decent but the UX is bad. The most obvious thing is unskippable transition, it such a spit in the face to the original P5 UX. To do something you need to watch TRANSITION, it's unskipable and slow it makes doing everything in the main menu feel sluggish, I hate it. It's so bad compared to P5 which is very concise, stylish, responsive, fast and clearly designed with player in mind. Pretty sure the designer in this game should learn from Masayoshi Sutoh and Hisayoshi Kijima (the UI designer of Persona 5 and Nier: Automata).\n\n[h2]Stripped Velvet Room[/h2]\nThe velvet room is a stripped down version of the original, I don't like it. It feels limited and it lacks the charm of the velvet room.\n\n[h2]The Persona skill is not well designed and battle is a bit mindless[/h2]\nA simple case: \"maragi\" previously it used to attack fire to all enemy in front of you, this lead to many interesting decision like:\n[list]\n[*] \"should I save sp or damage everyone with fire?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that drain fire, is it worth to attack everything but some of them gain health?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that reflect fire, is it worth to attack everything but I take damage?\"\n[*] \"should I finish this battle in 1 turn or wait for the next few turn?\"\n[*] etc\n[/list]\nBut in this game, maragi just simply attack wider range. It doesn't effect anything, there's no interesting decision its just a mindless skill. This not only happen to maragi skill but happen to buff/debuff and the gambling hama skill. The battle on this game is a bit mindless, I'm not saying P5 is hard but it had many interesting decision during its battle and I feel there's no such decision being made while I play this game.\n\n[h2]Conslusion[/h2]\nIf you like persona games, I would bet you'll like the story of this game. If you really want to know what's happen, go a head and play it. I don't like the gameplay and if you can't stand mindless gameplay and nuisance that I mentioned above, IMO its not worth it to push through it and better with watching youtube gameplay.\n\n[h2]Final Score: 2/5[/h2]",

        "content": "Hello  there  ,  hope you are doing well  . I have finished the game but for some reason I forgot to write a review for this amazing game . So , let me begin by saying that if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal ,stay way  from this game at all costs  if you don't want your experience to be ruined (If you have specific questions about that ask  me in the comments and i will  try to explain  as much  spoiler free as possible) . Since  I am afraid that I might spoil  something and the fact that  English is not my mother tongue language , I will be short  :\nPros  : \n- Soundtrack :  Even though  this is a sequel/spin off and clearly I thought that the budget is gonna be less , I expected that  the quality  would not be as good as Persona 5/Royal , the game absolutely  destroyed my negative expectations . I can safely say that the quality of the different songs of  this game were on par with the soundtrackk of Persona 5 if not better . And  Lyn Inaizumi with her superb tone and really good control on the high notes, a great overall performance as always . Give her some love please on Twitter .\n- Engine : I really don't know what Engine did they use on Persona 5 strikers but  the textures for characters ,objects,game terrain are light  years more clean than the  Persona 5 Royal (which have a slight upgrade on it's graphics in comparison with  the vanilla Persona 5) . And  even though this is anime or as some smart people like to say it ''a weeb'' game , the game looks soooooooo good in 4K  60 fps and everything  on the highest  settings to the  point that I could not believe it . \n-Gameplay: At first ,  when it first was announced for the Japanese market I thought that the gameplay will be  broken , poorly made or whatever you want to call . And I was sure (for some reason) that this type  of gameplay will absolutely not  fit well on a Persona game so decided to ignore it since I believed that it won't have a Western release . After some time when the game was announced for the West , I decided  to take the risk (due to my bias towards the Persona franchise and Atlus)  and preorder the digital deluxe . So the early access released  and  I started playing . Not only it is not boring  but it also has so many many creative mechanics that build on the Dynasty Warriors gameplay  formula and make it wayyyyy more fun  than I expected and it  felt so good using the different new  mechanics  .\n-Story (SPOILER FREE) : Even though I have the bias i already mentioned above  ,  I never expected the story of this spin off (which also servers a sequel to Persona 5) to be so well crafted . Of course , not as big (that\u2019s what she said) and good as the Persona but so much better than your everyday spinn off \n-Duration/NG+ : First of all , the playtime I currently have is not  accurate because I have spent  1-2 hours looking  at the preorder bonuses . Also this is the duration of my first playthough and I haven't started yet NG+ .  NG+  is neccessary if you want to earn al the achievements . I am the type of player that likes to look every nook and cranny of the game , unlock  all the abilities for the characters , do all the side quests first  and then start doing the main story to unlock new side quests (and repeat ) until I finish the game  . \n Cons: \nThe only  thing I didn't like was the epilogue(it was rushed in my opinion but it probably they didn't have the apropriate budget to make it  smoother , I can't be  sure )  and fact that [spoiler] you can predict after a certain point  in the main story who the main antagonist is so I wish they would have hidden this person  better but it didn't bother me that much . Don't make that stop you from buying it , it is just my personal whining [/spoiler]\n\nOoof , I wrote more than I expected . Before  I  leave please leave  a comment if you  have anything to ask before buying in the comments . Have a great day and stay safe !!!!!!",

        "content": "The first Persona game I have played was 5.  it was fun at first but as you go you realize every enemy fights the exact same and every single battle is the exact same tactic.  Tactic, strategy what ever you want to call your plan in battle is the exact same every fight, hold R1 to find a weakness on an enemy to get an \"all out attack\" to build your special, or \"showtime\" meter.  I cant finish the game because it became so mundane and endless talking and cutscene's.  Every time you encounter an enemy they have to talk to you first then change their form into what you'll fight, which is also confusing why they all have one form to speak and one to fight in.  \n\nI think these games are over hyped and end up long over staying their welcome.  If it had an intelligent combat system and intuitive and changing enemy types it would be far more engaging.  Not for me personally.  I'll stick to the God of Wars when i need some melee story telling exerperience and you should save your money and not get this dull game.  Having forced myself to attempt to finish this game I'm calling it quits at 44 hours in.  Use me as a lesson and not your wallet.",

        "content": "I absolutely love [i]Persona 5[/i], it\u2019s actually one of my all-time favorites, and I remember how I wished for a direct sequel after I finished it. Never would have imagined that my wish would come true!\n\nWell, sort of, at least. Story-wise, [i]Persona 5 Strikers[/i] is indeed a sequel (although most of the side characters from [i]P5[/i] are absent, and don\u2019t expect to develop/continue any romantic relationships, either), however, the battle system is quite different this time around. I, for one, wasn\u2019t a huge fan of this new, active, real-time combat. Sure, you can get used to it pretty fast, it\u2019s not very difficult, controls are pretty fluid, and it can definitely be fun obliterating huge hordes of enemies \u2013 it\u2019s just that I, personally, have always preferred turn-based battles in JRPGs. \n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, there\u2019s nothing I could complain about. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, including all the beautiful anime cutscenes, the story is meaningful (although maybe a bit weaker than in [i]P5[/i]) filled with relatable characters, and the music\u2026 God, I loved the music, just like in all [i]Persona[/i] games I\u2019ve played so far! Admittedly, most of the songs are from [i]P5[/i], but I didn\u2019t mind that at all. I\u2019m telling you, the soundtracks of these games are incredible.\n\nAll in all, even if you\u2019re like me and are a bit intimidated by the battle system, I think you should give this one a try. There are less social interactions than in [i]P5[/i], no minigames, less characters, but in exchange, you get more cities to explore, [spoiler]and even some new Phantom Thieves![/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel/spinoff to Persona 5. Unlike it's predecessor which was a turn based jrpg with dungeon crawler/social sim elements, Strikers is an action hack and slash game in the vein of Dynasty Warriors.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this game is how familiar to Persona 5 it feels. It has so many little touches like the player being able to pause the game and view the dialogue log mid conversation. All of the player's companions return from the original which is a very welcome inclusion. As a huge fan of Persona 5's story and characters the primary selling point for this game was being able to continue the adventures of Joker and the gang. Which this game delivers. On the flipside this is also potentially the game's greatest shortcoming. It's a direct sequel to Persona 5 and fully expects you to have beaten that game before playing this one. Considering Persona 5 isn't on Steam (as of the writing of this review anyway) this is a massive problem. Because of that if you haven't previously played P5 or P5R you will be rather lost in terms of the story and general gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe action rpg combat is serviceable albeit very simple. It feels kind of mindless at times and selectively makes you pay attention when it throws a challenging enemy at you. It does feel like the developers did their best to try and make an action rpg out of Persona 5's combat. However I never felt like it ever surpassed that game in terms of strategy or personality. I can see this game appealing to people who were turned off of Persona 5's turn based combat. However because it's story expects you to have beaten P5 it also doesn't really appeal to newcomers. \n\nAll in all in terms of being a spinoff/sequel to Persona 5 it delivers. It gives you more of that game just with a different spin on things. Outside of that though if you weren't crazy about the original like I was it's hard to recommend. Especially since Persona 5 isn't on Steam as of yet. Hopefully if/when that game releases, Strikers can have a second wind on Steam. But til then it remains as a novelty for the minority of PS4 owners who own a gaming PC and were also huge fans of Persona 5.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers overall does a fantastic job of bringing P5's characters and gameplay to a whole new style of combat.  Fights are smooth, the combos are satisfying, and it still feels like Persona combat.  Elemental affinities are still present, and Joker can freely swap between available Personas.  Every playable character feels unique and has a moveset I feel accurately represents them.  For example, Morgana can transform into his car form seen in Mementos, and several of Makoto's combos involve riding Johanna or rapid punches.  The story overall was pretty good and helped make this still feel like a Persona game.  The Phantom Thieves are rather static characters compared to the original game, but instead they help others find their own way, especially the two new members of the Thieves.  However the first few Jails can feel rather...samey and formulaic.  It doesn't help that every boss fight takes place in a castle.  It loses some of the uniqueness seen in P5's Palaces.  I also don't think the Jail Monarchs have the same impact as Palace rulers, but there were good ones.  \n\nOne major returning part of the game to really tie it back to the Persona series is the Velvet Room.  Lavenza alone manages it this time as Igor is nowhere to be seen.  And this was honestly what I felt to be the weakest part of the game.  Especially coming nearly fresh off of Persona 5 Royal, the Velvet Room felt very bare bones.  Persona Fusion works in pretty much the same way, but there's not much else.  You gain the ability to level your Personas directly up to Joker's current level with a new currency, but it gets very expensive very quickly.  Not helped are the new restrictions that the Personas themselves now must be at a certain level to be fused.  This wasn't a big deal in the early game, but trying to get powerful Personas in the late game was a chore as they often required Personas acquired in early Jails to be at a level far past when they stop learning new skills.  For example, King Frost requires Jack Frost and Jack-o-Lantern to be at level 40 while Joker to be at level 66.  But Jack-o-Lantern might be around level 8.  So the only way to get him the extra levels is to spend the new persona points.  But I at least could not find a reliable way of getting them besides re-summoning and dismissing high level Personas.  Gaining new Personas in the field is random; there is a chance a defeated Shadow will drop a mask for Joker, and that chance can be increased by leveling a skill.  Repeated Personas will give persona points instead of exp like in P5.\n\nOverall this is still a very fun game with fantastic music and a decent story, but I think Persona 5 Royal is the more polished experience.  But for a spin-off sequel in a totally different genre?  It did a great job.\n\nOne last note: the digital deluxe edition is slightly misleading.  The art gallery and OST are locked in a separate application with no built-in way to download the contents.",

        "content": "Calling this game a spinoff of Persona 5 would be a disservice. Despite a huge difference in gameplay Persona 5 Strikers feels more like a proper sequel. Not only that but I can wholeheartedly say that I had more fun with P5S than with the vanilla Persona 5.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, at its core, is a Musou type game with Persona mechanics. Meaning, a hack'n'slash with hundreds of enemies and some RPG elements. And surprisingly such combination works very well. The production values are quite impressive, with a brand new story reuniting the Phantom Thieves together, as well as introducing some well-developed new characters. The way the characters interact feels like a proper Persona game, and while the core story isn't anything groundbreaking, it is still very well presented, with some nice twists here and there. Honestly, I think I enjoyed the story more than the vanilla Persona 5, mainly because the characters we interact with are not just simple one-dimensional villains like in the original.\n\nDespite lacking the social-life aspect of previous Persona titles, many other elements unique to that series are present in Strikers. And the action-oriented gameplay works very well with them. Kind of brings back memories of the Devil Summoner series from the PS2, only better and even more dynamic. With several different playable and customizable characters, as well as dozens of Personas to fuse for the main character, the hack'n'slash gameplay doesn't get tedious too fast. Mashing buttons won't get you far, as there's still a need to be tactical and aware of enemies' affinities. That said, even though I'm no action game expert, I've found the controls to be very intuitive and comfortable. Rarely had any issues controling the characters or running around the environment.\n\nThe game looks and sounds great. The style is very similar to Persona 5, and the new music is very catchy, whether in battle, dungeons, or during free-time. Environments are numerous and varied. This goes for both the dungeons and the Japanese cities the party visits during their trip.\nThe game runs at 60fps and the PC port is honestly surprisingly good. Never had a single technical issue and the game ran very smoothly with no frame drops whatsoever.\n\nWhereas the original Persona 5, for me, got tedious very fast, I've found Persona 5 Strikers way more enjoyable. To the point I've started the New Game + on the highest difficulty only to appreciate it even more. Sure, there are some flaws, obviously, but my point is that the game is really good and every fan of Persona 5 should give it a try. Other people maybe not so much, mainly because Strikers is a direct sequel to Persona 5, which I'd suggest either play or watch beforehand.\n\nOverall, a great game that doesn't deserve to be called a spinoff, because it's much more than that. I've had tons of FUN with Strikers and I'm pretty sure I'll replay it again someday.",

Now that that is out of the way, this game is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the different fighting mechanics that were brought in despite being a persona game. Rather than being the typical turn based it is all real time. My complaint about this system is that there isn\u2019t much variety in the move sets. The story is overall pretty good, not the best but still very enjoyable. The OST is S tier per usual when it comes to a persona game with some twists on some of the classic Persona 5 songs giving them some extra flair and energy that felt much needed for a musou game. In one of the dungeons I did experience a really bad bug, which caused the game to freeze a ton. It did hinder my enjoyment in the game and I do hope it was fixed. Other than that, I believe it to be a solid game",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an interesting mix of Persona 5 story, characters and lore with the typical Dynasty Warriors gameplay (haven't played any dynasty warriors yet). Whether you like this game or not will depend on what you liked in Persona 5 more, which is either the life-sim/story or the gameplay or both. \n\nAlso btw, this is a full-on sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) so I would highly recommend playing that one first. Not just because it gives you more insight into the characters but it is also a better put together game, albeit with its weaknesses which P5S has seemed to borrowed over as well.\n\nIt is definitely a game made for people who have played and fell in love with Persona 5 before. Great music, great characters (new ones too) with an interesting amalgamation of both the combat styles, but highly leaning towards the use of Personas in the active battlefield. I was no longer waiting 120 seconds per turn to think about my next 3 moves, like what I would do in Persona 5. Now you have to make split second decisions, but you can always open up the persona menu mid-battle to pause time and think about your strategy a bit. Some levels are poorly balanced so feel free to adjust the difficulty if you retry more than twice on a mission, unless you are in it for the challenge.\n\n1. My biggest problem with this game is the same problem that I had with P5.\n\nThe story and the pace of it is just too slow at some points especially in the middle, where you feel like the story is not progressing anywhere and we are basically waiting for something to happen/give us a clue. Some dungeons are just too big, and they throw the same enemy types at you and you steamroll through them till you reach a boss which spices up some things but largely uses the same skills, tactics etc. Lots of potential here to make you feel burned out and bored if you figure out some strategies which work in the short term.\n\n2. My second biggest problem, I don't think the game puts enough emphasis on using persona skills that automatically trigger when you execute a particular combo. This is especially helpful with Joker since he is the most versatile one and using the skills in combos drains 0 SP, so you still get some chance to retaliate at low SP. It's basically a weakened version of a skill but takes no SP. SP is still a rarely found resource in the game and especially when there is no checkpoints to save your progress and refresh your SP in sight.\n\n3. Third, I feel the story and dungeons were too repetitive and simplistic this time. The story repeated itself for 3-4 dungeons (these were the long ones too imo). Go to the dungeon, chase the red marker, kill everything that stands in your way. I saw this in P5 as well so I think it carried on from there but the most complex things that the dungeon crawling in P5 and P5S require from you are simple yet gloried fetch quests. I would have liked to see the dungeon crawling requires at least 10% of my brain power to clear through them.\n\n4. This point is deriving info heavily from the P5 story so most of this is in spoiler territory. [spoiler]The plot lacks originality. The story is pretty similar to P5 (the characters say that they have seen this happen themselves). The bosses have more backstory this time so that's nice but still it seems pretty formulaic by the time the story tries to create suspense because the pacing issues I mentioned up there. Zenkichi and Sophia are welcome additions to the crew however. I think Zenkichi's addition should have happened sooner that it did because the plot picks up after that point quickly. The pacing issues is something I really hope ATLUS improves on because plenty of people just leave games when they get boring or some people just stop paying attention to the stuff going on (like me during the mid-game).[/spoiler]\n\nEven after all my criticisms, I feel this game deserves a genuine try by Persona fans because there's still plenty of things to love here, especially Persona 5 fans like me. I think I just bought this game for the UI as soon as it came it out :P",

Similarily to dancing all night it takes the persona characters you know and love, and expands the ever growing universe of persona 5. Great game as a follow up to P5 and P5R. If you like mowing through waves and waves of enemies (similar to hyrule warriors, or dynasty kings) you'll love this game and enjoy the enthralling story telling and wonderful voice acting.",

Same cast of good looking idiots as last time, plus a few new idiots. Good times.\n\nOn the one hand, lots of fun being able to eat as much food as you want while combat is paused. Makes the game a cakewalk.\n\nOn the other hand, I really miss the risk factor of having to take a combat turn to eat and get my health back up.\n\n\n\nAlso, on the topic of technical issues, the Steam version has worked just fine on my PC for 80+ hours, so I think they fixed whatever was giving people trouble before.",

The cast now feels more well-rounded.\n     > Road-tripping through Japan as the setting was great as I was familiar with several of the places the Phantom Thieves visited and it reminded me of how much I enjoyed my own trips.\n     [spoiler]> The devs did a helluva job in introducing and establishing the new Phantom Thieves Wolf and Sophie as relatable characters. Sophie in particular reminded me a lot of Vivi from FFIX in that her journey of learning and growth was also central to the story.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Things I'm meh about or disliked:[/h1]\n     > The combat mechanics were just ok for me. I settled into them more or less by halfway through the game but boss fights more or less devolved to P5-style of fighting - buff, spam elemental weakness, toss items around like crazy. Gimme the old turn-based combat any day.\n     > The slice of life stuff that really drew me into P5R felt lacking here. As mentioned previously, I wish the game leaned more into that especially since the original premise of P5 was supposedly a big jaunt around the world which Strikers is delivering on a smaller scale.\n     [spoiler]> The post-Kyoto storyline devolving into a retread of P5 was kinda disappointing. Konoe as Shido-adjace (even down to the boss fight mechanics), Demiurge being character-wise a repeat of Yaldabaoth, and the final 2 jails being Mementos-adjace left me a little let down by the final 3 or so hours of the game.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Overall: A good, almost-great sequel to P5.[/h1]",

        "content": "I was on the fence about this game at first. Yes, it is a continuation of P5 (one of my favorite JRPGs), but the choice of combat style a la Dynasty Warriors seemed a weird choice for me. Indeed, it took quite some getting used to at first. Many of the battles will present you with so much information on screen that it can be difficult to keep track of what is happening. Hordes of enemies swarm and remembering certain attack combos in unison with summoning your Persona felt like a feat in multitasking compared to the original combat of P5; though this may be more my lack of experience with hack and slash games if anything. Showtime attacks, which felt like more of an after-thought in Royal, return center stage akin to ultimate moves in combat, with each part member having their own unique set. \n\nHowever, after a while, the combat became fun once I grew accustom to the controls. Playing this on PC, I would highly recommend plugging in a PS4 controller over M&K. There was something satisfying in the flashy and stylish way each Phantom Thief performs in a fight. Beyond the main combat, it keeps to the series' traditional Persona fusing system, along with the same familiar abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Any veteran of the Persona will pick up on these with ease. Rather than Palaces this time around, each stage comes in the form of a \"Jail,\" tied to a particular boss. Even after completion, you can revisit each one to tie up lose ends such as obtaining a particular Persona or completed side jobs that will occasionally come in. Another change is lack of Confidants or daily social activities in favor of focusing largely on the main group. \n\nIn terms of story, this game is a direct sequel to Persona 5 (vanilla, not Royal). The Phantom Thieves reunite to tackle another threat as they travel Japan in a grand road trip. It follows much of the same structure as P5 in finding the current big bad, taking them down, and moving on to the next target. No new formula here, but if you're looking for more Phantom Thieves goodness, this game will offer it. I will say that this game is not nearly as long as its predecessor; I finished at about 54 hours, which included a bit of time building my Persona team and tackling various side jobs/bosses. Story is nothing new or groundbreaking, but I personally still enjoyed it. \n\nMost of the same beats are here: stylistic combat, great music, an engrossing story, and the same lovable cast of characters. There is not much more to say beyond that, as anyone coming out of P5 will feel at home here (at least once mastering the combat system). While not as grand as those of the main line games, it is a worthy sequel to try something new and help pass the time waiting for P6.",

Which is fine, because the old stuff is good.\n\nGameplay was enjoyable for me on Normal as somebody completely unfamiliar with Warriors / Musou games. Every character is pretty useful throughout, and identifying the best strategies for them is rewarding. Bosses can be pretty damage-spongy though, and you definitely will feel underleveled if you try those very-powerful-demon requests as soon as you get them.\n\nRan very well on my system, without any noticeable issues aside from one random crash. Game lets you save freely outside of dungeons and at any checkpoint within them, so impact of those can be minimal.",

        "content": "I can not recommend the game in its current state.\nIts very buggy, plagued by breaking bugs like freezes, infinite loading - very frustrating since they often waste lot of your time. These are no secret and you can easily find lots of reports and people asking for solutions on game own forums. Developer keeps releasing \"beta\" hotfixes, none of which fixed issues for me.\n\nI am not sure if these issues have something to do with poor support for AMD CPUs, generally poor multithreading stability (some fixes suggest issues with hyperthreading) or some issues with Denuvo DRM uses.\n\nAlso keep in mind these bugs tend to happen most on late game levels, at time where you are well past return window. I wonder if developer deliberately spent most time polishing start of the game to avoid refunds.\n\nEdit: After 13 additional hours, Steam suggested \"do you want to revise your review\".\nWell, I still don't recommend it. I managed to get through buggy stages, but it was super-frustrating, I had to redo couple very difficult boss fights when game decided to freeze on me.\n\nI somehow managed to get through by a lot of manual hacks by playing with CPU affinity, and later actually using Visual Studio debugger to un-stick the frozen game (having programmer background helped). Still I feel this was way above what average user can or should be able to deal with, so \"Not recommended\" verdict still stays.",

        "content": "While I do think the game is very good, the combat isn't as great as you might think. Most battles on higher difficulties turn into you spamming SP because there's no way in hell you're beating some of these bosses otherwise. Stronger moves cost a large amount of SP, unless you have certain Persona abilities. Be ready to chug sodas or other SP restoration items. I definitely advise playing on easy so the combat doesn't start to drag and bosses don't take a long time. The combo versions of spells just don't cut it.  At all. You'll either get knocked out of it or get it off and deal basically no damage. Combat basically comes down to this cycle: heat riser -> apply status -> spam technicals and/or weakness -> recover SP. I've tried several times to play the game any other way and the payoff is never worth it. The moment I got Spell Master, the other party members might as just not exist. \n\nOkay, now that the bummer part is out of the way. The story is great! The new characters fit in perfectly and I want more of them. The old cast bounce off of each other and the new characters very well! The music is incredible and a lot of boss designs and set pieces are really good. \n\nThe quality of life for Persona abilities is great and definitely should be added to the main games going forward. Merciless drops items that increase a stat by 1 so other party members can achieve 99 in all stats, which is pretty satisfying. Fusion is a little lack luster, requiring some persona to be very high leveled and there's just not that many to fuse. Persona take forever to level, and using the persona points system is really tedious. You essentially buy and release the same persona over and over to get more persona points. The ultimate persona is just Lucifer, which is a bummer given the potential of P5's ultimate Persona in this game.\n\nYou probably won't encounter these issues unless you play on hard or normal, and you'll definitely avoid most of the fusion issues if you aren't achievement hunting like I was. If you like Persona 5, you'll like this game. Simple as that.",

The combat, while different, is very fun with the different ways of fighting and a good way to adapt a tradition JRPG to a more action-based combat system. I'm not too far into the story but I think it has done well to incorporate aspects of real everyday life with EMMA being similar to other tech in the real world. Can't wait to play more and would 100% recommend it to anyone (though I'd suggest playing Persona 5 first because there are things you need to play/watch the prequel to understand)\n\nEdit 1: Finished the second jail and came to say that I LOVE the story, taking the persona 5 characters and placing them in positions that mirror their past selves is ingenious because it shows how the characters could have ended up before finding their real resolve from the main character and how they react to those going through a similar fate.",

I'm always down to get more of the amazing characters. And this game introduces some new and awesome characters too!\n\nThe combat also surprisingly works REALLY well! The hack and slach feels satisfying and the mob density in some fights is really good!\n\nA quick note - Don't forget to save MANUALLY. Its been a while since I played P5 and I totally forgot I have to save manually lol. Don't think this game has auto saves at all. So, keep saving! I lost like 3-4 hours of progress cuz I was gaming late at night and forgot to save before I hit the sack.\n\nOverall a easy 8/10 for neutrals.. and a 9/10 if you are a Persona fan (like me)!",

        "content": "Going into P5S I was expecting to suffer through what I've found to be typically uninteresting and monotonous Warriors-type gameplay for the sake of seeing the next part of the Persona crew's story, I came away pleasantly surprised, with not just my expectations challenged, but my skills as well.\n\nFor a Musou this is a surprising in-depth game, and it's really remarkable how much painstaking effort went into making it as P5 as possible. In fact, if I had to complain it's almost too similar to P5. This is true for gameplay, atmosphere, and even story--it hits many of the same beats, including a couple of the more tiresome ones. It does a great job expanding upon a few of the characters, most notably Haru and Makoto, while also introducing an excellent newcomer in the form of Zenkichi.\n\nSome characters don't get much spotlight, unfortunately, like Ryuji and Mona, and I lament that the development of this game coincided with that of P5 Royal, so none of the excellent additions therein with Kasumi, Akechi, and Maruki are present. And though I really liked the presentation of the Persona roadtrip, less is ultimately developed by this story than I would have liked. It goes places, but in a self-contained way, sort of like some anime movies. Still, it's a solid experience, and if you enjoyed base P5, you'd probably be missing out if you skipped this",

        "content": "An enjoyable sequel to Persona 5. You REALLY should play through the original/royal before diving into this one as its a follow on from the main storyline of that game. That said it does NOT follow on from Royal's extra 3rd semester content so if you have gotten to the 3rd semester that does not apply here as this game was made at the same time as Royal. Albeit as of the time of making this review neither the original or Royal have been ported to PC yet so you will have to wait if you are PC only and pray that Atlus does port it after the success from Persona 4 golden's port. Personally i played through both on PS4 (Combined total hours of over 230 for Persona 5 and Royal, Yes i love that game so much i played through it twice despite its monstrous length).  Took me a little bit of time (about half way through the first jail)  to fully get used to the Musou style of gameplay as this is my first game of that type of playstyle but once i got into it its great stuff, The mixture of persona and that style of gameplay blends well in my opinion. Storyline is good for the most part (some parts may feel a little bit lacking but its still a good game) and there's a mixture of sizes for the jails. 4 are Longer more fleshed out ones while the other 4 are shorter and in some cases much shorter mostly for some storyline purposes. Kyoto's jail makes up for its length with a great ending boss fight though its a shame you can't refight it like the others. While some of the shorter jails are a little disappointing length wise this did not hinder my overall enjoyment of the game and its nice to have a persona game that isn't so insanely long. Albeit this game still has good length and it did take me some time to finish all the requests and main story etc and post game content as i like to take my time with games. Music as usual when it comes to persona games is fantastic and the game looks decent in a higher resolution.  In summary if you enjoyed the original Persona 5/Royal and can adjust to the Musou style over the usual turn based combat this is more goodness for you with the gang you have come to love.",

        "content": "[b]SPOILERS FOR P5R BTW[/b]\nOh no...\n\nI'll include small sentences underneath each paragraph for those in a hurry.\n\n[b]The controls[/b]\nStarting with a subject that honestly breaks the game for me, the controls.\nThe control mapping is abhorrent in my opinion, they changed the button mapping for nearly everything, starting with setting the automatic text forwarding to pressing in the left joystick to not being able to change the controls to what i would want properly. I.E. you can set controls for when you are in battle, but if you want to use that same button in the \"normal world\" you CANT. The game will unmap the button from when you are fighting.\n\nThis practically forces you to use the default keybindings, which suck so much that the game is borderline unplayable.\n\n\n\n[b]The music[/b]\nWhat for me was a BIG reason why i finished P5R was the incredible music. Sure there were a few bad songs, think about mementos and okumura's palace, but mostly, the OST was great! Now in P5S the difference between good songs and bad songs is amplified. There are a few absolute bangers like daredevil, the intro, and the remix of last surprise. But sadly, at least three of the songs that i had really wished that would've been gone remain. (Tension, Blood of Villain, High Pressure (seriously, fuck this song))\n\nOverall for the music, 8/10. Some songs are bangers, some i wish they would've replaced.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAs WarOwl would say, [i]it doesn't wooooork[/i]. From the boss fights with dialogue that you CANNOT focus on because the battles are now in real time instead of turn based which WILL make you miss story, to you being able to fully heal with no penalty whatsoever just by returning to the overworld and going back and the general clunky controls of some of your abilities... yeah, it doesn't work.\n\nClunky controls and poor game design choices. Yikes.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nYes i realize that i've barely played the game and that i'm nowhere near finishing it, but from what i'm seeing right now, this is not good. Unengaging, boring and plot-hole filled storytelling that does not address any of what happened during P5/P5R. Not for me.\n\nIt's short enough that you should just read it.\nPlease do tell me if the story gets better after the first palace, cause if it doesn't i don't think i'll finish the game.\n\n\nI'll definitely keep listening to some songs in the OST, and i love the opening, but i just can't see myself finishing this game any time soon.",

It's more than just a spin-off of Persona 5, it's also a great sequel and has my favorite soundtrack and gameplay mechanics out of the Persona 5 games. Definitely a more intense and action-packed game but it still allows you to take your time and plan out your every move. The combat is a perfect balance between a hack-and-slash game and a turn based RPG, it has all the same strategy of Persona 5 and more. It's not too difficult and it is still a good game for people who are new to the series.",

ARPG esk Dynasty warriors combat system with the persona system was one hell of a unexpected combination that works on a meta level. hope to see a P4 spin off using the their new hybrid engine for combat. considering P3, 4, 5 take place in the same universe, seeing a spin off like strikers would be gold imo. \n\nmy only issue is what they did to NG+ and Extreme(merciless) mode. \n\nDon't read this next part(spoilers)\n\n[spoiler] after beating another false god, NG+ is not unlocked like most other persona games, instead you are thrown into \"post game\" and given a boss rush set of requests with harder nightmare versions before you can face The Reaper, why is this bad you might ask? because in all persona games that feature him, he is a end game optional boss encounter that tends to be the hardest out of all before him, the Reaper does not screw around and forcing players to try and fight him to unlock NG+ is kinda harsh. if you struggle with dire shadows, you wont survive a minute with Reaper, ive been able to beat almost all the Dire shadows as well as prepping a fist full of high tier persona's to take on the Reaper. ive beaten him in every persona game so far, not gonna let him stop me from NG+ but for some people? they will most likely quit. defeating Reaper is also required for merciless mode(extreme) [/spoiler]",

        "content": "If you like the \"Warriors\" games (like Dynasty or Hyrule) and you like the original Persona 5, this is a brilliant sequel. With the best parts from both series, some of which was changed to flow better with the other, the gameplay is excellent. Things to be wary of. Although it seems as if the story is just Persona 5 again, it isn't. Although it does tread over similar ground, the wholly unique aspects and new characters like Zenkichi make up for it. Also, on PC there's a slight chance of infinite load times. That being said however, I personally only encountered it once, so as long as you save frequently (mainly before major events) it isn't a hassle.",

        "content": "This game is great, the characters are stunning, the writing enthralling, the action intoxicating but there are times it feels incomplete, a symptom of being stuck between two genres and having two rather different teams working on this game; the lack of truly unique social links, the absence of first game tie ins (there's no Mishima and I hold a grudge) and if you aren\u2019t fond of the hack n slash genre the repetition in combat and the music that comes with it can be overbearing. \n\nI do recommend the game, you could try and wait for a sale but unfortunately JRPGs, Atlus games, koei games and triple A games generally do not go on sale often enough for waiting to pay off. \n\nI believe if you like hack n slash games, like the Persona franchise, like franchise mixing, or like long games this game is more than worth the price and it is at least the sequel to a masterpiece, if not one itself. \n\nAnd for a much more in depth look into the many aspect of this game be sure to check out my video review of the game at https://youtu.be/LcN9Tlo83uU\n",

By itself the combos are not many, but they are well crafted enough to make it fluid and impactful.\n\nI did not present any issues from my end and I can definetly suggest this game as it has a great story with characters well developed, great gameplay, amazing music, the game is not short and enjoyable.\n\nAdditional note: I am glad to see Atlus bringing their games to PC and giving the PC community some love, I can't wait to see what they have prepared for us in the future",

        "content": "As someone who has played through Persona 5 Royal, I definitely love how they managed to turn a game that was once a JRPG into a Hack and Slash. The combat felt very satisfying and the story was overall fantastic, even the music was phenomenal. It was indeed a perfect execution of using a new genre for the series. The Persona series never seems to disappoint and I'm glad to enjoy the ride of this series. My verdict of this game will be a solid 9/10. The reasoning for the 9 is just because as much as this game is fantastic, I could definitely see some potential of including DLC like having Akechi or Kasumi as DLC Characters or maybe challenge packs like they did with protagonist of 3 and 4 that was seen in Royal where you can fight them and maybe gain their fusions to make their Personas. But besides that I recommend trying this game at some point if you have no other games to play.",

        "content": "So as a fan of persona 5 I just had to buy strikers and I wanted to do a review for other people who game to this game because of persona 5. I do a pros and cons type of review so I can make it as simple as possible. Now onto the pros\n\n[Pros]\n\n- [Combat]\nI love this games feel for the hack and slash type of game style they did not miss on the feel of combat and the enjoyment of constantly throwing out attacks and dodging.\n\n- [Bond] In the previous persona 5 it was done through spending time with characters and unlocking better skills, In this game it is gained through requests and story progression and is very neat upgrading the exact skills you want to.\n\n- [Personas]\nThey kept a lot of the old personas making it pretty fun seeing the old ones and knowing how to counter them off of memory from the previous game. I also like how in combat you can use the ability's as a combo that doesn't consume SP making the personas more involved since they branched more into melee combat it kept the feel of needing personas relevant.\n\n- [Requests]\nI seen a request and it allowed me to re fight a boss of a jail for a reward which was pretty dope not having to start a new game plus just to fight a certain boss again, which in turn gives the game more replay value without having to new game plus it.\n\n- [Fast Paced Combat] \nI enjoy running around and just slashing at every enemy in sight it makes for a more involved experience so you don't fall asleep while grinding levels as fast.\n\n- [Sequel]\nUnlike jumping from character to character when making a new game they instead made it like a sequel which was promising since I never played the other personas I wanted to relive the feel of the OG phantom thieves in persona 5. Making me want it all the more and I mention this because I have a con later down in the list making this make more sense to the rating.\n\n- [Art Style]\nIt's very unique in the environment inside the metaverse which I can appreciate a very lot since it makes it stand out from other games it makes you wanna keep playing the franchise.\n\nThis is my temporary review since I haven't fully played through and only have 10 hours into the game now onto the cons.\n\n[Cons]\n\n- [Sequel]\nSo far into my gameplay I haven't experienced much freedom which may be because I'm not far enough into the game, I really enjoyed the dating whoever you wanted or deciding what to do with your time. It strayed from the feel of persona 5 which makes this sequel a bit of a disappointment though this is a temporary review so this might change as I get further into the game and comments are enabled so if anyone wants to comment on this explaining how the freedom works I would appreciate that. I very rarely get time to play so it may be awhile till I get to see how it is.\n\n- [EXP] \nI fight almost every single enemy I find and I am still not a high level to where I can go through the area like its on very easy difficulty and that is not very promising for a time limited game time.\n\n- [Time Management]\nThe previous persona made entering and exiting the palaces and mementos much more problematic in this game they don't really worry you since you can go in and out as you please and your days won't end. It completely heals you and your sp is returned making it a lot less fun trying to survive on no hp or sp or even being tactical on how you use your sp/items.\n\nI do think this game will open up a lot of pros as I progress and this one specifically might just start slow but I will be back to update this review as I learn more things about the game.\nAnd this is the end of the review to all the people that stayed and read my review thank you and I hope you have a great day/night :3",

The combat was actually more fun than I thought it would be compared to Persona 5, which really helped make it feel fresher. The story was interesting and the new characters fit in perfectly. \nThe only issue I had with the game was some slight screen tear on cutscenes, but could just be due to my monitor more than anything. \nIf you enjoyed Persona 5 and want something fresh to keep playing, definitely give this a try.",

El gameplay es adictivo y divertido. Entre con un poco de miedo de que el gameplay sea igual al del Dynasty Warriors, el cual no me interesa; Pero no es el caso, este es mucho mas completo, interesante y adictivo. Al rededor de 40hs de historia. Recomendado!",

        "content": "Ware wa nanji\u2026 nanji wa ware\u2026\n\nFirst thing you must know is that the game continues the story of Persona 5 not Royal. No characters,events or ending are mentioned or seen in Strikers from Royal. Bare that in mind. It is a must to know the lore of Persona 5. Either play it or watch a no commentary walkthrough. Anime is not recommended as many things are lost.\n\nStrikers had a drastic change in gameplay from Turn base combat to Hack and Slash which made the game more fast paced and gives you a big window of how you will fight with shadows. As we might remember, Yakuza Like a Dragon also changed it's combat but to Turn Based which was not the best decision.\n\nNow we roam all around Japan to find Jails (Yes, now castles are called jails and they are not a little location but a whole city) and defeat Monarchs that rule them. There is no Memento for obvious reasons. \n\nThe game became very easy in comparison to the previous game. You are not limited with time anymore and can infiltrate jails as many times as you want. You don't need to raise your confidants anymore because there is a new system of Bond. You receive Bond Skill exp for battles,requests,bosses and so. You get points with each level that you can spend on skills that will help you in different ways. The shop is now a;ways in the hideout. One click and you can buy anything you want. You don't need to annoy poor Iwai for equipment or go to Takemi for meds. Ah, you will be hearing \"How many?\" and \"Are you sure?\" a looooooooooot of times, so be prepared. I warned you.\n\nThe story is as always good but there is one moment in the game which makes me question why the devs repeated themselves...\n\nBosses. If you played or watched Persona 5, you do remember that each boss was unique and you had to follow some strategy not to die. Sadly, bosses here are like regular enemies. Nothing special about them. No difficult stategy needed. You just need to mash the buttons and evade. Only the final boss was unique and had something different in the boss fight. \nI'll just give an example of Persona 5 boss. Madarame. Several phases. Painting and then fight with clones where you had to use correct skills to win. Here...just mash the down buttons. Maybe it was made so the game doesn't loose the pace and stays fast like all of the gameplay but these are bosses. When you beat them, you need to get the feeling that you won by doing something and getting the feeling that all the hours you spent to grind for a new persona wasn't just a woosh. \n\nIn general I like the game and it's new combat system. New locations were a nice change of pace and I hope the next game will have something more. Bosses need more attention because this is just a meh. I hope that the new game will have another cool story that I and other Persona fans will enjoy.",

        "content": "I should start this review saying that if you're new to the Persona universe, DO NOT PLAY THIS FIRST. This game is a sequel to the original Persona 5. This game fully assumes that you've played at least the original Persona 5, and doesn't give any background to new players, so play either the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first. I don't care if you have to watch an LP.\n\nAs a huge Persona 5 fan, I preordered this game and completed the story 4 days after it came out, playing nothing but this game. While it is significantly shorter than the original Persona 5, I can say that the combat is some of the most fun I've *ever* had in a game. You can totally feel the passion from this game, and the developers put their heart and soul into making something that will stay true to the Persona 5 vibe and the charm that made people fans of the game to begin with. \n\nNot even mentioning the SOUNDTRACK. This absolute banger of a soundtrack paired with super-intense-stimulus-overloading fights makes for some of the most fun you'll ever have in a hack n' slash game. Of course there are pretty easy to point out flaws with it like the story not being as long or good as the original, but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad for this game. If you loved P5, you will absolutely love this game.",

Characters and story might be a bit overwhelming for those who weren't exposed to the anime or p5r game before but nevertheless, it's still a game worth picking up.",

The warriors-style combat mechanism is actually pretty fun and rather refreshing if you've always been used to the usual Persona style of combat. \n\nNG+ really takes the cake in this game. It turns out the strongest persona in the series isn't Yoshitsune, Alice or Lucifer. Turns out it's a Bicorn in the Merciless tutorial.",

You will find yourself fighting the controls more often than fighting the Shadows. The story is very good, gives the spotlight to each of the Phantom Thieves more effectively than the base game. But it's not worth the awful gameplay. Either get it on console or just look up a Let's Play.",

It also adds to the character of quite a few main characters, which is nice because some of them were sorely lacking in the first Persona 5. \nWith that being said, it's incredibly similar to the first story and I found the final boss to be incredibly underwhelming, both in concept and as an actual fight.  Along with this, the story takes place over the course of a month, but don't let that fool you, there's still a lot of playtime to be had from the game. \nIt lacks a lot of the key elements of the series, like the turn based combat, social links, and time management, so don't go into the game expecting that. It does offer a few unique things to better fit with the style of game, but if you're expecting another Persona 5 Royal, you will be disappointed. \nNot the best game in the franchise, but it's still incredibly enjoyable nonetheless.",

        "content": "great game with a great post game as well which is unusual for any persona game. its basically a warriors game with persona elements which is a lot of fun with the combat forcing you to either pick a general use persona or a persona that has a specific element that can counter the shadows you fight. it should be mentioned that you can control your team members and a lot of times they can handle the fight themselves since they all have excellent movesets.\n\nbiggest problem i have with this game is the persona fusion system. the persona fusion was way more in depth in the normal games than compared to this one as a majority of fusions are dependent on the level of the persona and really the arcana (especially in late game). its pretty annoying to grind PP to level up your late game persona. (I am aware that there methods to circumvent this but still the requirement on levels is annoying).\n\ntl:dr good game ryuji says fuck",

        "content": "[u]Persona 5 Strikers is the best game I have played in 2021. [/u]\n\nHowever, its existence on PC is a harder sell as the game's story is a continuation from the PS3/PS4  game Persona 5. Yes, you can just pick up and play Strikers, but unless you watched the anime, or played the prior game you won't know the characters, their backstory and all of their character nuances and personality traits.\n\n[b]So what is the game?[/b]\n\nIt's a story driven action game with RPG elements. As you play the game you're tasked with infiltrating 'Prisons'. You fight your way through until you defeat the boss at the end. As you progress you collect Personas. Think of these like Pokemon. Each Persona has different skills and abilities. Some heal, some buff or debuff and some do fire, wind or death magic. You level up your characters and persona to increase their power and learn new abilities.\n\n[b]The Good.[/b]\n\n[u]The voice acting. [/u]\n\nThe game isn't 'fully' voice acted. Some sections simply have to be read, however similar to the game this is based on, large sections of the game are fully voice acted and the quality of the voice acting really elevates the game. All of the voice actors from Persona 5 have reprised their roles, with the addition of Nolan North joining the cast as the detective Zenkichi.\n\n[u]The combat. [/u]\n\nThis isn't your typical musou game. Rarely is the screen filled to the brim with enemies. Instead, as you traverse the area, you will see enemies roaming around. You can choose to avoid them or 'ambush' them for a tactical advantage. Combat then starts with a small group of enemies to defeat. The combat is fast and satisfying, blending in a range of melee combos, ranged weapon attacks and abilities (think spells). Enemies often have weaknesses that can be exploited, leading to the opportunity to deal massive damage.\n\n[u]Music.[/u]\n\nThis is obviously a personal preference. I like the Persona 5 music a lot. The Striker's soundtrack builds upon the existing soundtrack making slight changes, such as heavier guitar riffs.  The only glaring example here is the first 'prison' stage. The music is a stark contrast to the rest of the game. It's akin to something you might hear on a pachinko or slot machine. It's loud, noisy and is particularly grating on the ears. \n\nMy personal preference is to use the DLC which allows you to use combat music from all of the previous Persona games. As a fan of the Persona series, I'll always choose to engage in combat with Mass Destruction playing.\n\n[b]The Ok.[/b]\n\n[u]Story.[/u]\n\nThe story of the game is in a weird place. Persona 5 Strikers is the story sequel to Persona 5, but not Persona 5 Royal. That means that none of the events of P5R have taken place. Not game breaking, but something to consider. The story itself is fine, if not a little predictable. It's welcome that the characters continue to develop past the P5 story. Hearing Haru refer to herself as 'Beauty Thief' again was welcome.\n\n[u]Fighting when?[/u]\n\nPersona 5 has a lot of story. Some of it is voice acted but a majority of it is reading conversations between The Phantom Thieves. Sometimes you just want to get back into the action, but you'll need to wade through the story elements first. I personally liked the story, but some people might not expect this much from a fighting game. Be warned.\n\n[b]The Ugly.[/b]\n\n[u]Eternal Bonds.[/u]\n\nMy only real criticism of the game came from my desire to 100% it. In particular, one Achievement stands out as egregious, and that is \"Eternal Bonds'. To get this achievement, you need to raise your Bond level in game to 99. Raising your bond level happens as you play the game. Major story events, killing rare bounties and defeating bosses will all net you some bond level. However, I completed the game around the 48 hour mark. I then started new game plus and played through it again. Even after two complete playthroughs, I still didn't have enough. \nI grinded one particular rare bounty for about 10 more hours. In hindsight, I could have played NG+ on the hardest difficulty, but I did so up until completing Alice's Palace, but the progress on the bond levels didn't seem any faster.\nSo there's a reason only ~3% of all players have completed all of the Achievements. It's due to Eternal Bonds. If you plan on grinding bond levels, be prepared to do a lot of this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0x5VNsTkQ \n\nIn the end, I did 100% Persona 5 Strikers. It's one of the few games I've sought to do so with. I still maintain it's the best game I have played all year and I do recommend it.",

The game's fighting mechanics are really fun, and each of the playable characters have fun movesets. New features such as leveling up Personas using Persona Points feel right at home for the series. Plus, for the first time in Persona history, the game can actually be difficult. Hard mode is ACTUALLY hard! It almost feels like a real Shin Megami Tensei game in terms of difficulty. In terms of story, this works very well as a sequel to the original Persona 5. All of the characters are enjoyable (except for Morgana, rot in hell you little shit) and feel like they're the same characters that I got to know so well in the original. The new characters such as Sophia and Zenkichi are phenomenal additions to the cast. The only problem in terms of characters is that there's no Goro Akechi or Sumi Yoshizawa, but that makes sense. Atlus, just please include those two as DLC. All in all, I love this game, and I hope Atlus continues to add more to it!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers, while not like other games in the series, is still an incredible game in my eyes.\nSPOILERS BELOW\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIn terms of gameplay, Strikers is akin to Hyrule Warriors, with the aspects of Persona gameplay mixed in. There are 4 difficulties; easy, normal, hard, and merciless, which is only available in NG+. Personally, I played on hard mode up until the Osaka jail, because by then, it took me around 30 minutes or so to clear out certain prison keeps. Normal is a good difficulty for people who are possibly new to the action format (such as myself) and I have not tried easy, but given that its easier than normal, its most likely forgiving. The aspects of normal Persona mixed with action style gameplay is interesting, but in my experience, it is very rinse and repeat. Honestly, I couldn't do too many of the special moves or master arts, because enemies always hit me down before I could finish them. It was much easier to charge Joker's gun, or just spam whatever the enemy was weak to. As for the requests and jails, it's a mixed bag for me. The requests are decent, and dont take much time to complete, but that's about it. The jails are interesting, but unlike Persona 5, they don't offer many hiding spaces for ambushes, causing you to have to either be ambushed, shoot an enemy from far away, or attempt a direct hit. However, they are more action packed in my opinion. Using the environment to do phantom dash attacks are quite nice and can create cool combos if you can use them correctly. All in all, the gameplay isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular either. My biggest complaints are that A. you can only see the telegraph for an enemy's attack if you are facing them, and B. you MUST be locked on if you want to quickly use a magic attack and keep the flow of your fight. I would, however, definitely play this over almost any triple A game made today.\n\nAs for the story, it essentially follows that of Persona 5. As a direct sequel (or spinoff? Royal makes things weird.), it takes place after the collapse of the Metaverse and after the Antisocial Force's semi-disbandment. Personally, I think that Strikers has a few loopholes that I won't go too deep into, but it does have some \"aha\" moments, but also some poorly instigated moments that just feel like a plot device. The story is still alluring, and I was invested the whole time, but some parts could have been a little fleshed out. The interactions between the Thieves were nice, however, which is one of the main things I like in Persona games.\n\nThe last part I'll probably talk about is formatting, graphics, ect. Frame cap is 60 fps which isnt the end of the world, but I did notice that Yusuke's showtime did lag out my computer occasionally, and sometimes when the camera pans out to a birds eye view or a showcase of the palace, there were glitched out portions of the screen, but that wasn't anything too bad. Nothing compared to the infinite loading screen I got on my rematch of the final boss :( But regardless, the game looks nice, obviously similar to that of the original Persona 5. The menus are nice, and the game has a lot of color.\n\nAll in all, I would still say this game is one of if not my favorite games on Steam, and for good reason. Every game has its flaws, but the world of Persona will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nPlus the music, too. Just buy the bonus content and listen to Counterstrike forever. Songs a banger.",

        "content": "I went into this game thinking I was going to play a Warriors game. What i got was a Persona game masked as Warriors game.\n\nI love the Persona series, but it works way better in turn based combat than in this basically real time madness where enemies are many and their skills even more. I also love Warriors games but here I can't get that almost immortal superhero 1 vs 1000 feeling as I have to dodge around and make fights as easy as possible with ambush tactics. Until the game throws me a boss or a mini boss with multiple times the difficulty I've had for the last 2 hours or so.\n\nI really wanted to like this game as it combines two of my favourites, but I can't really enjoy either side of it as is. It might be because of my expectations: I wanted more Warriors less Persona. I wanted to check my brain out and play hack 'n' slash game, but what I got was more of JRPG game with clunky gameplay.\n\nIf you enjoy the game, good for you. But I got more frustration than enjoyment and I would not recommend the game at this time. Maybe when I go back to the game at some point and just lower the difficulty to easy I can get something from it. At this moment, I just want to enjoy my evening and not get angry at a boss fight.",

You are always fighting with the only time you're not being scripted events, shopping for items or finding clues for a new jail and given this is a Dynasty Warriors game, the gameplay becomes VERY VERY repetitive coupled with the plot makes it feel like I'm being thrown in a loop.\n\nthe gameplay on paper is fun, it embodies some of Persona's original gameplay like weakness abusing and stuff but it just feels so stale coupled with the fact that every Jail feels the same makes this a hard recommendation to even those like me who wanted to see what a Persona 5 sequel would hold.\n\nThis game would've been made so much better if the Life sim part was still a thing and I'm not saying this because I'm one of the fans who plays the games for that reason only I love Persona 1 and 2 and they have no life sim its just that this games plot would've benefited greatly from a little breathing room now and then.",

        "content": "[h1] Well first things First, [/h1]\n\n You need to beat or watch (a play-through I heard the anime isn't too hot) Persona 5 to get some real enjoyment out of this game but you don't necessarily need to do the same with Persona 5 Royal. From what I played, there's no real spoilers from Royal I think but there could be secrets that I don't know about.  So playing royal isn't necessary but probably gives some extra flavor with some interactions more than likely. \nNow you might be asking yourself\n\n [i] Why do I need to play or watch Persona 5? [/i]\n\n well my good sir, ma'am or whatever pronouns align yourself with, this game is essentially more Persona 5 with a side of dynasty warriors game-play instead of that classic turn-base Persona Flavor. [b] If you haven't played or watched Persona 5 this game will not be that entertaining for you! You'll be buying a game that's basically an extra chapter to the Persona 5 story. If you have done so then the bold section does not pertain to you. [/b] Continuing on, You're not about to get all of the social simulator mechanics that Persona is known for but you'll be getting the aesthetic, music, and main cast interactions from it. If you want more of that this game is for you as this game is filled to the brim with fan-service but not the NSFW variety SO BACK TO TWITTER YOU GO YOU FIENDS, but I'll be joining y'all later.\n\nNow the for the main game-play...\n\nIts not for everyone.\n\nThe Dynasty Warriors formula is not the most responsive game-play of the bunch. At times you'll swatting away at a boss with long health bars for minutes on end. Luckily, they spiced things up by adding some SMT (Shin Megami Tensei a.k.a the series Persona derives from) mechanics which allows you to exploit the bosses weakness to beat them but that also go both ways. If you choose the wrong party for a fight some of your party members will get erased from the surface of the earth but if you already played Persona you'll be used to it. You can still customize your party to whatever play-style that suits you so if you want your Ryuji to be a physical Damage Chad you can do so. In particular with the game-play, I don't like the dodge function in this game, it took me while to understand it but I feel they could done of a better job at implementing it so you can dodge attacks more properly. Despite this though, defeating massive waves of shadows can be therapeutic but as I mentioned its just not for everyone.\n\nUltimately I think you should watch some game-play for a final verdict, Seeing is better than reading and if you see what I'm talking about you might be hooked or save some money in your bank account. If you're missing some Persona though this game is absolute must-buy specially if it get on sale for a better price.\n\nP.S\n\nWith the PC version the game was buggy in the past but since then I believe they patched \n certain things up so if you see any reviews about it being buggy make sure you check the date as the game could of been patched since then or there still could be issues with it. My experience wasn't too bad, I do admit to have issues in the beginning when the game first came out but after a month everything was smooth sailing to the end.",

        "content": "All the new songs and remixes of the old ones are insane, just like the in the other persona game(at least p3+), especially the new track Daredevil.\n\nThe gameplay is on the same level as original persona 5. i really recommend doing your first playthrough on normal and then play it on merciless new game plus, enemies scale with your level there, so its the difficulty where you actually experience the combat.\n\nFor optimization, its nearly perfect, i ran it on Radeon HD7800 series(gpu from like 2013 that is also in ps4) and i was getting 60 fps 95% of the time. If you have some stronger gpu put the resolution on 4k because the game either has dogshit or no antialiasing at all.\n\nStory. Its a persona game, Also play the original Persona 5 before this, because its gonna spoil a shit ton for you, and you also wont know who is who and why is what happening.\n\nOnly thing i kind of didnt like about it, is the forced \"Fuse by Result\" fusion option from other games, and that to fuse some higher level personas you had to level some level 15 persona to 65, good you can boost them with ingame money(which is the only actual way to level them up because the xp they are getting is miserable).\n\nOverall i rate this game 10/10 a perfect sequel, i dont regret spending 60 euro on this.\n\n\ntips:  If you get stuck on the first bicorn miniboss because he oneshots you, its ok, just try killing him until you do it, and then you can continue enjoying the rest of the game. The goat is busted as fuck, he \u00eds like 2 times harder than any other miniboss, or maybe even as hard as an actual boss.\n        If you bought the old songs dlc, go to settings>game settings and scroll until you see what soundtrack you want to listen to. Select random. If you dont like some of the songs in there, you can turn them off.\n        After you defeat the final boss and watch the credits, your save will say the game is completed, but it really isnt. Load it, and you will get called to the velvet room where lavenza tells you to kill all the bosses again, and when you kill them, you will get a request for killing The Reaper, if you do that, you will get an achievement, and will be able to play ng++\n       You will transfer everything, except for some story items to new game plus, including your level money and compendium, so if you finish the first playthrough at level 80, you will get level 90 and fuse lucifer in no time.",

The story feels like a wonderful continuation of what the original Persona 5 had to offer, and its unique combat style as an installment of a series of turn-based JRPGs gives players a fresh way to enjoy the Phantom Thieves as they jump back into action stealing hearts all over Japan. Everything this game offers, from the opportunity to experience characters I know and love once again to the absolutely amazing soundtrack fitting of the Persona 5 atmosphere, has me completely satisfied. I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who enjoyed Persona 5 and wishes to see the characters developed further (especially Haru).",

        "content": "P5S is a great game, and even though it's technically a spinoff, it feels like an extremely organic sequel to Persona 5 with a different combat system. Highly recommended it to players who enjoyed P5's characters and themes. If you liked P5 for only the turn based combat and didn't appreciate the characters, P5S is not for you \n\nIf you're looking to get into Persona, this is not the right game as it's a sequel through and through. Persona 4 Golden is a much better option,\n\nI found the gameplay to be rather enjoyable and thought it had a surprising amount of depth. The hack & slash setting and Persona based combat blended together rather well. There is however, no real social sim aspect and there is no confidant system. That being said, the character development for almost every character is really impressive. The new characters are also very well done. As usual, the OST is an absolute banger.\n\nCombat can get repetitive, and there are a few quality of life changes (accepting requests outside of the RV for instance) that would really help the experience. Persona fusion is also drastically simplified. There are only roughly 60 personas and fusing some of the last few takes a lot of grinding.\n\nOverall, if you liked P5 and are ok with a new combat system, this is a must have. If you're new to Persona and want to play on PC, start with P4G.",

        "content": "Despite its flaws, honestly a pretty good sequel/spin-off to Persona 5. Probably one of the best spin-offs we'll get of a persona game, it's just pretty solid all around.\n\nThe cast of characters from the original game are just as enjoyable as they were before, and I really like the new additions of Zenkichi and Sophia, they're pretty great as well. Especially Zenkichi, he's probably one of my favourite Persona characters now. \n\nMusic is amazing as usual in this franchise, all of the battle themes are bangers, even the music in some of the cities are really great to listen to as well. \n\nGameplay is where I think I had a few problems with, as well as the story. The combat whilst being fun at times, I felt like could of been improved slightly or perhaps just not as repetitive as it was. Whilst I liked the action combat this time around instead of the turn based system in the original game, the novelty of it got old quick for me at least, and I didn't really enjoy it towards the later parts of the game. It's not bad, I just think it could be improved slightly (even if I'm not really sure how? I felt like sometimes the combat was just spammable sometimes with certain moves, or doing different combos weren't really rewarding). I still think how they implemented Personas in the combat was still pretty well executed though, but perhaps could of reduced some of the SP drain, as I felt that sometimes was pretty hard to manage at times. \n\nThe jail designs were pretty cool, but most of the time, I didn't really think too much of them as level designs. They weren't bad or anything, just nothing really memorable. \n\nThe story, even though I enjoyed most of it, felt formulaic and VERY similar to the original's. It's not bad, but perhaps slightly unoriginal and predictable times. Still felt it was interesting to go through though, and was definitely better than what I was expecting. \n\nOverall, I personally really enjoyed P5S despite its flaws. Honestly a pretty good spinoff to Persona 5, and you HAVE to have played the original to enjoy the game in my opinion, as it'll spoil you quite a bit of what happened in the original, and you'll miss some of the references. If you didn't like the original Persona 5, then I can't really recommend this game to you. If you were a huge fan like me of the original however, DEFINITELY get this game, you'll probably really enjoy it.",

        "content": "After a lot of struggling, I decide not to recommend this game. It is hard to argue the game is totally terrible, but I spent 80+ hours on it.  However, I do want to point out some fatal issues with this game which lead to my decision. First, the plot is filled with cliche. The story is highly predictable and boring. Second, personas play an awkward role in the combating system: on the one hand, creating/upgrading personas is so complicated, but personas are not necessary for non-merciless fights. So, it seems that there is a complicated system of personas that you would feel that it must mean something, but it actually does not really make much change until you play the merciless mode. On the other hand, once you play the merciless mode, the fight is unnecessarily hard and tedious without the proper personas, yet, the right personas basically make fights as a cycle of releasing persona skills, refilling sp and releasing skills again. I found myself push the same 3-4 buttons in the same order for 5 minutes to complete a boss fight in the merciless mode, which is boring. The creator failed to strike a balance between non-merciless game and the merciless game as well as the fight with and without strong personas. As an action game, fighting is one of the most important elements, failing to deliver challenging yet enjoyable fights makes the greatest failure of this game.",

The Characters - old and new - are done wonderfully and work great with each other. The plot starts out interestingly and knows how to balance increasing tension with the relaxed feeling of a road trip through Japan. \n\nI have no experience with Musou/Dynasty Warrior games, but the gameplay is fun and snappy - a lot of switching between your party members during combos to utilize their strengths and weaknesses. It can get a little stale thou if you play longer sessions without a break. \n\nAlso... The game is immensly more stable than at launch. Meaning I encountered no more crashes. Some cutscenes still feel like they are a little lagging, but the game itself looks good and plays on a smooth framerate. \n\nIf you loved Persona 5 and want more of the characters then this game will make you happy.",

        "content": "A game that goes beyond its inspiration, and accomplishes something truly special.\n\nAs Strikers is a sequel to a game that isn't yet on PC, I feel obligated to say that there will be marginal spoilers for the original Persona 5 and Royal here, at least insofar as areas that I will be directly comparing to with Strikers.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Persona, and cited Persona 4 Golden as my #1 favorite game of all time until only a year or two ago. I love the focus on slice-of-life melodrama and cheese mixed with 'friendship is the true power!' anime goodness. The music is always god-tier, and the cast of characters are almost always endearing beyond easy comparison in the genre. \n\nTo say Persona 5 was a disappointment isn't exactly fair, but there were plenty of areas it fell short in, not just in relation to its predecessors, but entirely within its own goals, that I still talk about with my partner to this day. While its invention of an entire district called 'Shibuya' was no doubt innovative for the medium, spawning many spinoffs such as The World Ends With You or even a widespread effort in 1990's Tokyo to more closely mimic the buildings seen here, unfortunately that same inspiration couldn't be seen in the pacing and intricacies of its narrative. To go into greater detail here would be straying closer to writing a review of Persona 5 rather than Strikers, but I'll simply say that as the credits rolled on 5, I was filled with no great desire to ever see the Phantom Thieves again. \n\nThen Strikers came along and- I wish I could come up with a better phrase- stole my heart.\n\nStrikers' abandonment of the Social Link and time management systems that dominate the mainline Persona entries was publicized well beforehand, which caused me to be much more reticent about picking up the game. Would plot be taking a backseat? Would these already thin characters be reduced to little more than an aesthetic for Musou combat? \n\nIf those same worries assail you, please believe me when I say nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves flourish under a much sharper and much more tightly-written story here than in their own debut. While nothing deeply shellshocking for the genre, the plot has plenty of emotional gravitas, culminating not just in these pre-established heroes. but in practically every new addition to the cast. People act like human beings here, not 'shitty adults' or plot automatons. The core party has chemistry and plays off of each other brilliantly, and are even given actual time to enjoy themselves and more fully indulge their personalities beyond the most surface-level of jokes based on their eccentricities. \n\nThis story works in tandem with an absolutely phenomenal combat system. I've only had a very slim amount of experience with Musou games in the past, so I can't draw many comparisons, but I will say that simply getting through by button mashing is an impossibility. If you want to get through specific minibosses or even regular enemy encounters past the first few hours, you have to apply constant thought to your actions, thinking a few steps ahead, just like in JRPGs, while also honing your instincts and committing combos to muscle memory. It's an extraordinarily well-done fusion of genres that I very sincerely consider to rival the best in the business. Neither the turn-based roots nor the slasher reworks overshadow each other; instead, they compliment each other like sunlight illuminating a pane of stained glass, revealing how each individual facet constitutes a brilliant whole. \n\nI absolutely adore Strikers, and would argue it as better as most of the other games in its series, mainline, or spinoff. It understands its heroes' motivations better than the original game's writers, presents a beautifully innovative combat system, and strings along a truly magnificent score to lend each and every moment even greater impact. It's a masterwork of a title, and definitely the best game I've played so far this year.\n\nWell worth every last penny, and so many more.\n\nThese devs deserve a raise.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a wonderful continuation of the world of Persona 5. The characters maintain their growth and prove how memorable they are through dialogue, the story is a heartwarming romp across Japan, and the music keeps the funky flair mixed with newfound upbeat tempos and hard rock to hammer home the extremely hype show-stopping moments of the game. With a run time of 90-100 hours and then some for those who want even more, the price is well worth it if you are looking for a new action game to sink your free time into.\n\nHowever, the combination of classic Persona mechanics and action game speed, timing, and reflexes, along with some new innovations or streamlined bits, creates a super cool blend of worthwhile progression that is as addicting as it is semi-frustrating. You can only get better at the game by practicing your moments of striking while the iron is hot, but when ambushes effectively end encounters before they begin when the Phantom Thieves gain higher levels, sometimes there are points when you are just waiting to put your button skill and game knowledge to a real test. It is a minor grievance, but admittedly this was an issue on normal difficulty for me. I plan on trying out harder difficulties in the near future.\n\nOverall, this is a must have for Persona 5 fans, possibly Persona/Shin Megami Tensei fans in general who want an electrifying change of pace from the turn-based format that you're used to.",

        "content": "8.5/10 (9 if you are a Persona fan)\nPersona 5 Strikers is by definition, A Sequel to Persona 5 (not royal, as it does not seem to have references to that game story wise), and its a damn good one at that. Even though the game was not only using a completely different Fighting system, from Turn based to Warriors Hack and Slash like, AND was made by a different company, the game at large still feels and plays like a Persona game. What Koei Tecmo pulled off to recreate the Persona style is nothing but extraordinary. Many of their previous warriors games, in my opinion, were just plain boring. I am not a big fan of Warriors games, but somehow they made Persona 5 Strikers still feel not only like Persona, but an actual fun game (sorry Warriors fans). Now onto the pros and cons of this game.\n\nCombat: The combat in this game is simply amazing, especially for a combat system that I previously dislike. With the use of not only Personas and the Phantom Dash Mechanic making the combat feel unique and special each interaction, but also each character's unique playstyle and personality, while also staying true to who they are from the previous game. The game always tries to throw in a new gimmick or mechanic into the fight each time you progress in order to prevent the combat from becoming stale. Fighting large quantities imo is just plain satisfying, however fighting one, strong enemy can show the limits of the combat system. The game does try to spice it up with new mechanics, but it is obvious the combat was made for large groups, as slashing only one target doesn't feel as satisfying, and there were a couple of moments where I thought turn based would had made the boss fight more interesting.\n\nDifficulty: the game was simply easy, a bit too easy at times but at the same time, would be hard. It may be due to me doing all the requests in the game, but near the end it was very uncommon to die, as the game had many many, many forgivable mechanics in order to prevent death, while also many of the enemies would telegraph their attack, allowing for alot of time to react and dodge. There was a Merciless option too, but that was only after you beat the game + post-game content.\n\nStory:Im not going to dive deep into the story simply to avoid spoilers, but at large, the story was pretty damn good. Again, wasn't as good as mainline Persona games, but was still really good at the end and gave me the badass feel that the Persona 5 story previously gave me. The message of this game was also pretty good, tackling modern society issues, and having really complex characters, with none of them being just pure good or pure evil, but instead having reasons for their actions.\n\nCharacters: the Phantom Thieves has returned yet again, and I think they still were just as good as in the previous game. They even gave Haru much needed character development that persona 5 lacked in, while also making everyone else more fleshed out, while sticking to who they were in the first game. The New Characters were also amazing, as not only were the new main characters super fleshed out, but also the side characters and the antagonists were really amazing to watch and learn about. There wasn't really an amazing main antagonist like what persona 4 and kinda persona 5 had, but the story kinda went through the same story arc as persona 5 did, and tbh I was fine with it.\n\nMusic: as always, the Persona music is back and better then ever. The OST for this game consisted of mostly remixes of previous Persona 5 music, usually in a rock remix format. There was also brand new music for this game, and they were simply sooooooo goooooodddd. Idk how tf they produce bangers after bangers of music, but they do somehow. There was an issue for the ratio of new music and remix music, as I did feel like there was a bit too many remixes where they could had used a new song, but the remix were bangers anyways so I ain't complaining lol.\n\nSmall Nitpicks/Positives:\n-LOVED how this game felt like Persona 5: Sequel, with just a new combat system.\n-PC controls were awful, I had to remap a shit ton of buttons in order to make it playable. In the end I got it to work and made if playable, but there was still some issues I couldn't get rid of like how the camera was just either too damn fast, or too damn slow to rotate. I know the game was made for controllers, but whatever I am just that kind of guy.\n-The Voice mixing in this game was all around the place. Most of the time, it was pretty good. Sometimes however, the Voice actor would be too quiet, too loud or even have a drop in quality as if they didn't have any noise suppression. It was especially obvious during the beginning segments, like how sometimes even the character's audio would be so damn quiet I would have to repeat them, which just sucked. It was however pretty obvious it was due to the Voice actors having to record remotely due to Covid-19, so I think they get a pass in that regard.\n-from persona 5 to persona 5 strikers, due to the combat change, some things were nerfed or majorly buffed indirectly. The SP pool was still pretty small, that was just a 5 thing in the series and its back in strikers. However, items are just 10x better in this game due to not only having huge quantities to buy in the shop and around the city, but also due to now being able to pause the game and chug a shit ton of potions and food without the penalty of it taking a turn like what the previous persona games did. IMO I wasn't a big fan of this, as it did kinda slow down combat, but it was different due to the combat, and there wasn't much to do in that regard except maybe nerf the amount of items.\n-The game also had weird PC port things alongside it. Its obviously a console port of a game with things like 60 fps lock, game logic pauses when you don't focus on the window, till you go back into the game, and even with max details, the game seemed to have an anti-aliasing issue, with characters and further away objects just looking pretty pixelated imo.\n\nIn conclusion, the game was still really damn good, especially for a persona spinoff title. This is most def the best spinoff title from the entire persona series, but I still think the turn based combat should stick for the mainline series going down. Even though I really enjoyed this combat system, it did have its limitations, especially with large boss fights that the other system didn't lack. Of course large quantities was better in this system, but hey. Other than that, this game is especially worth to get if you played Persona 5, as this is just a continuation sequel to that game. If you are a first timer however the game is still really damn good, but you maybe lost in the story element and characters as you don't know who they are and what they did before, as they especially make tons of references to the previous game. I still think you can go thru this game w/o persona 5 experience, but I still highly recommend playing Persona 5 First. The length of the game took me around 50-55 hours, which also included me doing all the requests that was allowed in first playthrough, which is a really damn good length and so worth the price of the game (idk why people complained it was too explained like ok lol).\n\n8.5/10 (9 if you are a Persona fan), really damn good game.",

        "content": "Out of all the persona franchise games I've played, Strikers is probably my new favorite! Although honestly ever since P5 came out I've been in love with this persona installment. The story for Strikers was fun and I enjoyed watching the characters get to take a road trip together xD The mechanics for the game are very PC friendly since you can customize them pretty well. Just be warned that there is lots of button and mouse mashing ;-; The play style is also very different than what is characteristic for persona games which are typically turn based, but I actually really liked the style used in strikers, as it was more engaging and action packed. I will caution that the game covers some pretty heavy topics, but if you are a fellow persona or P5 lover this title is a must play.",

Its good tho would recommend it you played through p5.\nAlso Ruji says the f word so.......",

This game play is different from the usual turned based combat that persona games have and I actually love the risk they took it payed off so much having to use personas mid fight is a really nice mix up. Bosses were really nice and challenging. But the final boss just didn't feel challenging. I think the boss should be buffed. Rest game was amazing the enemies weren't so challenging to make you want do pull your hair out. Overall was really fun to play. I might just replay the game cause it was so much fun.

        "content": "P5 strikers continues a few months after the end of Persona 5 with spoilers regarding many of the events of Persona 5. Strikers does not contain content from persona 5 (The) Royal such as new characters.\n\nPersona works like final fantasy in that each entry in the series is self contained but shares elements between all of them. Personas (The spirits/demons/manifestations you summon to help you fight) and other mechanics work similarly across the other games but the story can be understood and is grounded on an individual basis.\n \nPersona 5 in particular is inception meets anime and Persona 5 Strikers tosses the turn based combat system for a real time fighting game with a story centered on travel around Japan. Outside the dungeons you advance the story and prepare by obtaining items such as healing or buff single use items and equipment and accesories that affect stats and damage. In the dungeons you manage your energy to clear objectives advancing towards the goal of stopping people from hurting people, just like base game 5. \n\nYou have a nice full team with different fighting styles you can swap between but you're really gonna stick with the main character, Joker, due to having the most direct power progression and for him being the character who's perspective you'll experience most of the story from. As soon as the game gives you the chance I recommend just learning how everyone works. Exp sharing is on I think but people will still lag behind I think. You'll want everyone about the same power.\n\nPersona as a series knows how to use a great deal of subtlety, but it's main ideas it will remind you of often, and loudly. The great music being the best example (Im looking at you \"wake up, get up, get out there\" from 5!) The story is about many things but remember growth and understanding are at the center. It's very anime, trust the power of friendship. \n\nMy main enjoyment of the games' stories is that they help with introspection of ideas by having a wide range of approaches presented to you with many of their consequences and logical/emotional fallacies shown clearly.\n\nGameplay wise: Hit those weaknesses! Your auto combo does different stuff depending on which persona you have and each enemy has different weaknesses. Thanks to free abilities with certain persona combo attacks if you have the skill you could go entire boss fights not spending any energy- if you manage to survive that long and have the patience, otherwise press the persona button to pause the game and aim an ability. This uses SP which less items and abilities recuperate easily. Keep a wide variety of attacks available, fighting without hitting weaknesses gets expensive fast and every time you leave a dungeon to recuperate the enemies re-spawn.\n\nPersonal recommendation for a game mechanic I wish I knew about sooner, accumulated power: If you feel low power in the game fuse more personas towards your level cap. Don't be afraid if a persona becomes a lower level than the cap from a fusion, it will eventually get more stats the more you fuse the resulting persona. \nIf you do a newgame + run...check the guides.\nHaru best girl don't @ me.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a strong recommend for fans of Persona 5 (P5), but I don't think the game will be nearly as enjoyable for people who aren't familiar with P5's characters or the Persona franchise in general. The combat was surprisingly fun for me, as I don't really enjoy this particular genre of gameplay (previously played Dynasty Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors), but it isn't good enough if you don't know anything else about what is going on in the game. \n\nBut I am a fan of P5 and the Persona franchise, so I really enjoyed spending more time with these characters and meeting new ones. The story is good enough but I was craving a more personal connection between the plot and the heroes. The story was more intimate and impactful in P5. \n\nWhat I missed most from P5 was the time management and relationship building portion of the game, but this did make Strikers much easier to get through and it was a very focused experience. So while I would have liked to see more of this in a Persona game, I ultimately don't think it took much from the experience.\n\nSo an easy recommend from me, with the caveat that I think this game has a very specific audience.",

        "content": "Ahh, Persona 5 Strikers, I've been wanting to get my hands on you for awhile, and now that I have, I can finally write a review. Now, I highly recommend you at the very least watch a playthrough of the original Persona 5 (Or Persona 5 Royal) first before picking this game up, as it's a direct sequel to Persona 5. I won't be covering the story of Strikers much in this review either.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of Persona 5, you once again play as Joker, as you and the rest of the Phantom Thieves travel around Japan for the Summer. That's pretty much the premise.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from the mainline games, Persona 5 Strikers is a Hack and Slash with RPG elements. The gameplay itself I found quite fun, and I definitely found a few of the battles a bit challenging, even on normal difficulty. \n\nOne of my favorite parts gameplay-wise is that I never ever felt the need to grind for experience. I never felt too underleveled or too overleveled. The game also reintroduces Persona fusion. And while not as vast as the mainline games, it was still quite robust and intuitive. Dare i say, some aspects of the fusion I liked more compared to Persona 5. \n\nWithout getting into it, the story was really good, on-par with most persona games. I found myself invested in not only the characters i'm familiar with, but also the newly introduced ones. And there were a lot of moments that made me visibly happy, sad, angry, and so on. And that's a sign that they did something right.\n\nContent-wise, this game has quite a bit. It only took me roughly 40 hours to beat from start to finish over the course of four days, then again I played it practically nonstop when I bought it. I'm a bit of a Persona fanboy, haha. \n\nI do also plan on completing this game 100%, definitely. This game has quite a lot you can do in it, even in post-game you still got some stuff left.\n\nThe english voice acting was fantastic. I plan to play the game again in Japanese to compare, but I just LOVE the english voice cast so much, some of the deliveries were on point, and I laughed out loud quite a bit at many lines.\n\nOf course, I can't talk about a Persona game without addressing the best part about the series. The music.\n\nGood GOD the music. It's fantastic! The music is a LOT more fast paced compared to the mainline games. All the battle tracks get me absolutely hyped to fight. And the remixes of songs like Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert, among others, were done amazingly well! I could listen to each track for hours and NEVER get tired of it! \n\nI did yoink the deluxe edition though, which means I got two DLCs along with the base game! So I'll cover that next.\n\nThe first DLC was the all-out attack pack, it gives you a bunch of skill cards, along with 10,000 Persona points you can use to level personas up. The skills cards were nice, but also a bit unnecessary since the game is quite generous with it's skill cards, doesn't really justify the need for the price tag. \n\nThere's also the BGM DLC, it adds tracks from various persona mainline games. In my opinion, this is the better DLC option of the two. Changing the BGM can help change battles up a bit, and the fact that they remixed the battle theme from Revelations: Persona just for this game says a lot to me.\n\nThe Deluxe edition also came with bonus content on the side! Such as the soundtrack, a digital art book, and Behind-the-scenes footage! Which I find really cool! Watching the footage gives you a glimpse as to how much passion went into the game, and I enjoyed watching it!\n\nNow that all that's been said, let's get into the issues I had with this game, it's mainly bugs and small issues though.\n\nOne of the biggest things i experienced was audio issues, in-game audio was cutting in and out, along with crackling and stuttering. This is most apparent when I went to shop for things and bought things over and over in quick succession, or when I was in a menu like the compendium and scrolling down from the top to the bottom really quickly. This also happens in animated cutscenes, which kind of breaks the flow of everything, unfortunately. It never happened that often during normal gameplay, but it was often enough to the point that it ended up being really distracting, Although it was extremely rare, the game would also crash, which definitely was a bit frustrating when it did happen. A smaller thing was various instances of voiced dialogue not matching the text box, and lastly, audio balancing with the english voices. Sometimes the english voice acting is hard to understand, they sound too quiet, even had to turn the music down so i could hear the voice acting. This was mostly apparent with soft spoken voices. I'm not too mad at the audio balancing though, since they were recorded during a global pandemic, so that's something I can let go. That's pretty much it with my issues. \n\nAll in all, if you don't wanna deal with the audio issues and rare crashes, then I recommend getting the PS4 version, as it's probably the best version of the game. But if you don't mind the issues and want the convenience of having it on your PC, or you don't have a PS4 or Switch, then get this version, it's still worth it! The game is not only a fantastic one, but it's also a fairly stable port! I didn't ever have any problems with framerate either, which is a plus! This game receives a 9/10 from me!",

And that game was Persona 5 Strikers.\n\nIn that moment i knew that P5S, wasn\u00b4t realy like is going to be masterpiece, but i was thinking that is going to be a good game and one to remember. so one week later after finish p5r, i buy this game and started to play the game.\n\nAnd two week later i taken out all the trophies, and i was feeling sad and odd. The structure of history was litterally like p5 (original game, not the royal), i feel like the game took all the things that i don\u00b4t like about p5 history and put again, but this time worse, but that didn't make me not cry at the end of the game, even so i feel like the game was missing something: the essence that the persona games have. and the very essence of p5, inclusive i doubt myself about all the persona games is masterpieces and then i reflect about this game, clearly for me p5s isn\u00b4t like a true persona game, even like p5/p5r sequel, but it\u00b4s have his moments, i cry and laugh, is still a good game and can be enjoy so much, like the gameplay or the soundtrack (Is quite impresive as always), but as a fan of the series and Atlus games, i personally don\u00b4t like too much this game.",

The new characters in the game are really good, too, and I really like the combo sets for both of them. The boss fights in the game that I've done are very good, and the combat feels very fluid and nice. (even though I still mostly just button mash and hope things go well.) Other than the combat, the story is handled well and feels like a natural continuation of the P5 story. Also, Yusuke is still best boi.",

It's refreshing to see a more hack & slash approach to combat though but still with the same old Persona charm and amusing banter.",

They've managed to fit the feel of Persona combat into a completely different battle style and genre, as well as to a point the overworld investigation parts. The overworld parts being extremely bare, but that's understandable with how many different towns they implemented. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and the character interactions it made happen which are one of the big things about Persona.\n\nMy only complaint is one of the dungeons is so long, they make new Requests available mid dungeon without needing you to leave for any reason. It felt like a really long stretch of just doing combat things. It needed some kind of mid dungeon story break point but that's just me. And it's only the case for one dungeon, all the others feel well paced and well designed.",

        "content": "Pros:\n\nGood character interactions (imo better than P5 or P5R, none of that Morgana vs. Ryuji drama)\nGameplay is addictive as hell (no seriously, the base game is like 40-50 hrs but here I am doing playthrough after playthrough because I just can't put it down)\nKiller soundtrack (then again, it's P5, you probably know what to expect by now)\nMore screentime for characters that were somewhat neglected in P5 and P5R, such as Haru and Yusuke.\nMany characters to play and imo they all feel pretty distinct, useful, and pretty fun to play\n\nCons:\n\nWriting (plot) is kind of meh, especially near the end, but it's not terrible\nSometimes freezes during loading screens (I've heard people say the 5th dungeon specifically, but for me it happens all the time, even entering/leaving velvet room, using shops, location transitions, etc.), which can undo your progress if you haven't saved recently. That being said, SAVE OFTEN.\nSP/persona skills seem unbalanced, especially on Merciless mode; you have to use skills multiple times to break \"shields\" on bosses, let alone down them for an all out attack, but the amount of SP each character has is similar to P5/P5R, where this is not the case. Endgame often turns into a case of spamming persona attacks and SP items (the grind for SP items is real, especially since shops don't restock unless you do multiple battles in the metaverse)\nSome controls are a little wonky (such as all-out attack, phantom dash, follow-up attack, interact, etc. all being triggered by the same button, with limited ability to create separate hotkeys for them). This seems to be a symptom of poor porting from console.\n\nYMMV (i.e. some info that may be a pro or a con depending on the person):\n\nNo confidants/social links, no time management (you can leave and re-enter the dungeons at any time to replenish HP and SP with no detriment), no turn-based combat (i.e. missing many Persona gameplay staples)\nThis is a direct sequel to P5, NOT P5R (and the story very much reflects this)",

I enjoyed seeing the characters I had grown to love in the other game continue to grow and work together. But the gameplay felt somehow more boring and samey then rpg battles.

The game's telling me that \"A\" is \"B\" and \"X\" is \"Y\" and vice versa. \n\nThis will be confusing for the player to use, and I don't see anyone getting used to it. Some might say that that button placement is ideal for an XBox controller, but the button mappings are displayed for the Switch pro controllers as well, like the \"ZL\" and \"ZR\" buttons.\n\nYou should settle for a DualShock4 controller or an XBox One controller (and heck, even the keyboard and mouse). Until an update happens that fixes the button placements, my opinion stands where it is at.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a very fun game. It takes what people loved about the characters and atmosphere of Persona 5 and made a sequel that was very enjoyable, but I will start with some problems I had. First off I can't really recommend this game to someone who hasn't experienced the story of Persona 5 in one way, shape, or form. The game does a good job of relating back to certain things in the plot for context, but you may not feel very connected if you don't know the content from before.  Secondly, the combat in the early game feels very repetitive, and not very satisfying. My friends who also played this game felt the same for some confirmation. You will need to start getting stronger and more versatile Personas before you start getting into the good stuff. This is an RPG so that's a given, so if you thought you could mash through the game it won't be that easy. Lastly, the story is kind of stale for the first chunk and feels like you're getting nowhere. Once the Phantom Thieves start piecing together the signs and make their way towards the bigger baddies, the story gets very good, very fast thankfully. This leads on to the good parts. The game looks fantastic on PC. The effects and landscapes pop with color and are a pleasure to look at. Also the mid-late game story is very good, along with the ending being very nice. An absolute plus is the post-game content. There are many requests you can do for stronger weapons and fighting harder version of previous bosses for a fun challenge. Though I had my issues I highly recommend this game to Persona fans, but give a smaller recommendation to new comers. Very fun, maybe wait for a price drop. 8/10",

        "content": "Both the best Warriors game, and least warriors game.\n\nPersona strikers is a sequel to the vanilla persona 5 that plays with the hack and slash combat of dynasty warriors.\nstory wise this doesn't have any plot points related to persona 5 royal.\n\nquick questions:\n\nWhich version should you buy:\nEither buy the game one PC or PS4, don't bother with the switch version. PC and PS4 are so similar it just comes down to your preference, on switch, the loading times are like waiting at your local dmv to retake your license photo while the old man is yelling at the girl behind the counter on why he can't show an ID to confirm his states residency so you just have ti sit there until he finally leaves so you can get your picture done and move with your afternoon.\nIts bad.\n\ndo you need the deluxe edition?\nNo. Unless you intend on doing multiple playthroughs and need variety in the music, there isn't any point to it. the all out attack pack gives you some resources that'll make the early game easier at the start. but after that, you'll be swimming in resources, so really your just paying 10 extra bucks for legacy music.\n\ndo you need to play any other games prior to starting this?\nNot unless you want to. Play persona 5 or watch the anime, you won't be super lost here. the game tells its own story that takes place a few months after the events of persona 5, though your not going to be drowned in call backs and references to the previous game. Its got a few places it takes itself for a persona game thats a fun ride, least to say, you'll be entertained if you're in the camp who just loves persona for its story\n\nHow difficult is the game?\nPlaying on normal mode, its fairly simple and wont beat you to your knees after the first couple hours. you might feel starved for resources at first, but after the first dungeon is done, you'll be fine. Worst case, if you fight tougher enemies without their weaknesses in your party, the fights will just last another 15-ish minutes.\nOnce you go into new game plus however, your characters will die in only a couple hits. Its doable, though a clear difference.\n\nhow long is the game?\ndoing a single playthrough on normal mode with doing every side quest, and most achievments, just over 50 hours. For completionist 86-95 hours since you will have to grind a small amount near the end.\nI 100% the game 86 hours and didn't feel like I was grinding at all until the last 3 hours. By far this was one of the most enjoyable games I've 100% as the pacing really doesn't struggle to keep itself together.\n\nNow for everything else:\nHow different is this game from normal dynasty warriors & persona?\nbesides throwing out turn based combat and the traditional calendar system, your able to freely come and go from the games dungeons as much as you want at no penalty to you.\nYou wont need to manage keeps and battle enemies in hordes and dictate who should target what, rather you have a set map you can be stealthy and fight enemies in with your 4 party members (who can be switched with the entire cast outside of battles ) will join the fight. killed a handful of enemies and move on. \"Keeps\" from dynasty warriors have been reduced to simply plot points on the map rather than a part of the map to take that you dont wanna lose.\nthere's a clear simplicity from the usual warriors spin off here and its all the better for it.\nPersona fusing is here again as you'll be getting sacrificing personas to keep yourself going.\nall the party members are useful this time around and you'll use them all fairly regularly through the main the main story.\n\nfinal verdict: 10/10\nTLDR: a solid hack and slash that doesn't feel like tedious, even into the games final moments of completion.",

        "content": "I started playing this game immediately after obtaining the Platinum Trophy for P5R on the PS4. It felt weird at first, after 190+ hours of turn based combat on P5R. However, once you get used to the changes, P5S is a true successor of P5R. This is a true sequel, maybe not so big as the original, but everything is here: all the Phantom Thieves, all the adventures, amazing music, top quality voice cast and loads of fun and things to do. I hope this game receives the Royal treatment in the future.\n\nSuggestion: Play P5R first before playing this game. There are a lot (and I mean a lot) of references to P5R that make you connect more with the plot if you know what they mean.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that Ann completely forgot about being my GF xD",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the Vanilla Persona 5 (PS3/PS4) game NOT Royal. With that being said, to enjoy the full experience of Strikers. The player must've played/experienced the Vanilla Persona 5, since there's a lot of inside jokes from that game. \n\nThis time around, Strikers is a Hack&Slash with some JRPG mechanics. Due note that there's no S-Links, no romance/dating options, and there's a lot of cutscenes. What makes Strikers unique from the other Warriors games is that it requires a lot more strategy. Meaning early game the player can't just spam magic attacks - which requires SP (Skill Points) to win every battle. Remember this is an Atlus game, they make their games difficult in the beginning to make sure the player understand the game's mechanics. \n\nJust like the other Persona games, there is a calander system.... eh kinda. While there are events in the game, Strikers is a very story heavy game. Even if the player exits a dungeon, no time/day will pass. Days only progress when the story progresses, so no need to worry about deadlines. There are some Social events that play out and trust me you'll want to get these events. Bonds are what replaced the S-Links, but these serve to improve/upgrade combat and gameplay. \n\nOverall, my experience with Persona 5 Strikers was a great one. I've 100% completed this game 3x (PS4, Switch, and pretty soon Steam). I will say there's an achievement called \"Eternal Bonds\" that takes forever to complete. Even though my playtime shows 30 hours, the game itself is about 45-50 hours (I skipped the cutscenes on steam, but not on PS4) its a lot of content for those who enjoy anime and/or Persona mainline games. I'd highly recommend it. Yes it works with the PS4 controller",

I've played P5 and P5R and there really is no comparison.\nI'm sad to see that there is no confidant system or relationships at all. If you haven't played persona 5 you might not get a few references here and there in this game but it's not impossible to follow along since they explain pretty much everything.\nI honestly recommend P5 on steam if Atlus ever decides to do that.\n\nOn a side note. I thought I was going to enjoy this game more because of the real time combat but in all honesty, this game doesn't give me that \"oomph\" when you land a critical or hit a targets weakness. P5R always made me feel like a badass every time you showtime a group of enemies and in this game it isn't really all that effective. Especially since the bosses tank that shit like it's breakfast.\n\nP5-P5R is just better IMO. I still enjoyed the game and i'm about to finish it soon.",

        "content": "A worthy sequel!\nI'll start off by saying that I dislike \"warriors\"-style games. They just don't do anything for me, but P5S managed to keep me engaged enough that I didn't really care what kind of combat I was dealing with. The battles were a bit more than just mashing the square button and had some variation based off yours and the enemy Personas which was nice. I think my biggest complaint is that the EXP share isn't a flat rate so you're forced to change out party members every 15 minutes if you want them to stay roughly the same level (which you do need to do).\nI could go on and on about the combat, but likely if you're buying the game, you're more here for the characters and setting. \n\nIt was great to have the gang back together (minus Kasumi and Akechi), and overall the plot was really enjoyable. Another thing this game did great was the setting. I thought I would be super bummed not being able to run around Tokyo but all the new locations were super detailed and interesting. I also have to say all the new characters are fantastic. I only wish I got to see Zenkichi and Akechi bounce banter off of each other.\nThere was also some more character development. Nothing ground-breaking but they did give it to characters who could've used an extra couple of minutes in the spotlight (ex. Haru)\n\nAll the new music was great. Obviously a lot of what you hear is recycled from P5 but that is no big deal since P5 has arguably one of the greatest OSTs of all time.\n\n\nDon't expect to drop another 150 hours into the game like you did with the original P5 or P5R as there's just not that much side content, and story isn't nearly as long.\nThe game will net you about 45 to 60 hours depending on if you care about being a completionist.\nOverall 8.7/10",

It was such a great game, if you're into dynasty warriors games it's a lot easier to keep playing the game. However, if you're new to this play-style I suggest moving at your own pace. I promise the game is worth putting a lot of time into. I really liked the music, gameplay, characters,visuals,  Koei and Atlus really did a great job. Everyone in the game had good dialogue, felt like the team really capture everyone personalities. Overall it's a great game, and you should subject yourself to spending 40+ hours trying to beat it and do some phantom request that seems somewhat redundant.",

The gameplay is a stark change from the normal turn based gameplay and is hard to get used to at first, but the Persona charm is still there as strong as ever. Definitely recommend to anyone who has played Persona 5 (though I don't think this game would be a good entry point into the series).",

In terms of story I was really impressed, the Palace owners in Strikers are much more complex in their character, making for some interesting morally grey areas the main game never really touched on. But there are a lot of great fun moments just hanging out with the Phantom Thieves on a cross-country road trip.",

I have never had a game do this before. People don't launch a separate app just to listen of a song... do better Sega. If you want the DLCs it is still a better price to go with the deluxe edition just don't think you are going to get use out of the soundtrack...they have made it an utterly pointless/useless addition. Overall the game is good so far 6hrs in, I am enjoying it. Just remember the Deluxe bonus material is only 50% usable and the descriptions are misleading.",

        "content": "PREAMBLE:\nI Don't think I can judge this game fairly. I Really did not like persona 5, neither it's main story or it's characters. All the problems I had with 5 are pretty much absent here. They don't gripe about adults every 5 minutes, they don't complain about society every 2 minutes and they also don't talk about how much better they are than everybody every second. I don't know if this game is great or if my low expectations after P5 make it seem great, but I do know that I want the combat and the writers back for Persona 6. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nUnlike P5, this game has active real-time combat as opposed to turn based combat. P5 tried to ad flair and look cool but it fell flat because the characters ended up just standing still and taking turns in combat. The sense of progression and picking the right persona for the job is still here, but with combat that seems to fit the story better. You have basic attacks. You have special persona attacks you can weave in with the basic attacks, and you have your normal persona abilities you know from the mainline series separate from that. This is what persona 5 tried and failed to make you feel, strong and powerful in the face of an army. There are also no more punishments and subsequent incentives to finish a jail in one day. No more time management YAY :D Time management was my biggest gripe with P3-P5, but it's not here.\n\nSTORY:\nDo you want to go on a cross country summer tip with your friends? me too :,( This is just a group of friends doing exactly that, kinda. Saying it's a rehash of P5's story would be a disservice, but it really does feel like the writers saw the potential in it's story and rebuilt it from the ground up. No more cartoonishly evil villains. All of your \"enemies\" are all shown to have suffered greatly and as a result their desires have been twisted. In P5 they were \"twisted\" because the story demanded it. No more \"I know whats best for society\" main-characters. In P5 they were pretty much just like the main villain, but were never called out on it or made to think about it.\n [spoiler] The main \"villain\" this time is actually just the Phantom thieves, but on a much larger scale. He points out that they can't help everyone, that even now while they are talking people are suffering. He want's to become a hero for everyone, to help everyone the phantom thieves can't. His way of doing it is to basically brainwash people, and remove freedom entirely (just like the phantom thieves can be argued are doing to their targets) and when it is pointed out to him that he is basically erasing peoples humanity and becoming like the figure who traumatized him he relents. I am a bit sad that no one pointed out to him that he was punishing the innocent majority for crimes committed by the guilty minority, especially since there was a cop there, but compared to P5 it is flawless. [/spoiler] \nThe characters never stop interacting with each other, so it really does feel like a friends group out on a trip. P5 did little to make them actually seem like friends that would hang out outside of Phantom thieves business, and while this does little to remedy that, it does pair all of them off to some degree. So while they may not keep contact with everyone, they will at least keep in contact with someone. I can see Ryuji and Yuskuke, Futaba and Yusuke, Ryuji and Ann, Makoto and Haru. Just like a real friends group, some of them seem to hit it off better than others. This felt lacking in P5, but there were at least more contained single stories I suppose.\n\nMUSIC:\nYeah, it's pretty good. Some remixes from P5 to make them fit better with the real-time action combat. The jails all have personal BGM as you are walking around just like P5. The first jail has an absolute banger of a track, while the others do their job of building atmosphere well enough. The last one can be argued is alright. The battle music really gets the blood pumping and get you ready for a fight. It makes what happens on screen just feel that more sick. If you bought the battle tracks from the other persona games as well, then you get a good amount of music to make sure you never really tire of any one of them. \n\nFINAL RATING:\nStanding on it's own: ?/10\nCompared to P5: 11/10",

        "content": "The best Persona spin-off, the best licensed Musou game and a fantastic hack and slash. \n\nKT, Omega Force and Atlus did an amazing job in striking the perfect balance between mainline Persona's RPG elements and the action gameplay of the Musou series. \n\nStorywise, the game follows vanilla P5's ending and allows us to see more interaction between the Phantom Thieves as they travel around Japan for their summer vacation. Writing is expectedly weaker than the main game (as is with Persona spin offs), but the new characters and group interactions pretty much make up for it. I'm not afraid to say Zenkichi is one of the best Persona characters and he carried the whole game. Sorry, it's the truth.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay, back when this game was announced, a lot of people were expecting this to be another mindless button masher like a lot of the licensed Musou games are, but P5S is far from that. Battling enemies incorporates P5's dungeon exploration mechanics to present smaller (when compared to a normal musou) but still fast paced encounters between big numbers of enemies. The addition of elemental magic, buffs and debuffs from the turn based games grants the gameplay a new layer of depth and more ways to deal with enemies other than melee attacks. There is some grind, but it never feels like a chore because the combat is really addictive and super fun.\n\nAs for the rest of the game's elements: amazing soundtrack (as is to be expected from Meguro) and vibrant and stylish UI and overall presentation. My only complaint is that the antialiasing implementation is terrible and if you don't force it with external tools, the game will look blurry and ugly. The port had some serious issues when it came out but most of them seem to have been fixed with the latest patches.\n\nSo, all in all, this is an amazing game. Bit of a hard sell to people who didn't play the original but for those who know what they're getting into, this will be one of the best experiences in the Persona series. Absolutely recommended.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a great game for the fans of the original Persona 5 game (and Royal). It is a sequel, so prior knowledge of Persona 5 is required to get the full experience. Of course, you could still play the game as is, but be warned that there are a few spoilers here and there so I would advise against it.\n\nGameplay wise, it is different from the traditional turn based style the Persona series is known for, that being Persona 5 Strikers is in a style of a musou game with Persona mechanics. This was my first musou game so it took a while of getting used to, but it was fun steamrolling through waves of enemies, and with Persona 5's flashy style and gameplay mechanics, made it a much more enjoyable experience. \n\nIn terms of story, I'd say it's pretty good although that could be my bias towards Persona 5 in general. I do think that if you enjoyed the prequel, you would enjoy this one as well. (I don't really want to say much as I can't really explain without spoilers, sorry.)\n\nLast of all, I want to talk about the PC port. For me, it ran perfectly fine for the most part, but it could be by many factors such as with the new patch (1.02), my hardware, and etc. \n\nFor those who want to know what my hardware I'm using, I'm using a Ryzen 5 2600 and a RX 580.\nThe GPU driver version that I'm using is 20.4.2.\n\nThroughout my playthrough the game only crashed 1 or 3 times but they were at minor parts (like an event with hanging out with Ryuji and Ann near the beginning of the game) so I'm glad it was mostly fine for me and I hope your experience goes smoothly. My computer also didn't suffer from the \"infinite black screen\" bug in the 5th Jail. I would advise to save whenever you can, just to be safe and to keep submitting your game issues to Atlus so that they could look into it and hopefully bring out another hotfix if you are still experiencing issues.\n\nOverall, this is a great sequel to an already great game, and I would definitely say give it a shot if you liked Persona 5 but wanted more content. \n\nWith the success of sales with this game, I hope Atlus and SEGA can continue to bring more of their games on to PC and multiple platforms. I personally do not see the point of having third party game exclusives as bringing games to multiple platforms will not only would bring in more sales, but it can introduce many people to their franchises, and it can make them more popular than they are now.\n\n:D",

I have found solutions for that and now i'm able to play full screen and have my regular load times. I have played a bit of Persona 4 golden, Persona 5, and Persona 5 Royal, so i thought that I would give this game a try. This game's style is very different from those games mentioned before, but I wanted to play this game knowing that and so far i'm having a very good time. (I would recommend playing with a PS4/PS5 controller Mnk works fine too but the others are better) If you have played the other Persona games I would recommend giving this game a try.",

The story was alright but could have been better, the combat felt more of a chore than something you would look forward to and that is not something you want in a game. The bond mechanic and bond skills were slow and knowing that strikers takes place after persona 5 it dosen't make since that they would have to create a bond when they spent the whole year of p5 doing that, most character felt like they lot lost a lot of their character development. I regret buying the game this is not a bias because i was not bad at the combat because i played on hard mode and even then the combat was just right it was not the time i spent playing it\nIf this is going to be your first persona game don't buy this rather buy persona 4 then 5 and if you still want more play the older 3 games then come back to this\n\n<Edit> The games only redeeming quality is the second to last boss fight he is a Dilf that dresses up as a poweranger",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a weird game.  The original game was a turn based rpg but this is a action game with rpg elements.  Think Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy 7 Remake.  Strikers is an actual sequel to the story of Persona 5 (not even Royal but the original Persona 5).  Also the original game is still only available on PS4 so if you don't have a PS4 and want to experience all the story before this point you are going to be shit out of luck.\n\nAll this weird shit out of the way, the game is pretty dang good.  Gameplay is fast and tactical. Lots of fun combos and can weave in persona abilities in-between them.  The music features some original compositions as well as tracks ripped straight from P5. The remixed battle themes are probably the biggest highlights here.  Story is entertaining but can feel a bit too familiar if you already have played Persona 5 before (even the characters will say, \"Hey didn't we do something like this before?\")  The new characters for the most part are pretty well written and interesting.   Voice acting is great.\n\nNow for my complaints.  This game can feel a bit too long especially with the story being predictable.  This isn't necessarily a complaint but I felt like more risks could have been taken here.  I also feel like there is not a huge variety of personas compared to all the other games.  There are a lot of cool ones here but it feels lacking.  A lot of the side quests are also pretty bland and lack creativity.  Kill X guys with X character repeat x50.  \n\nSo yeah, game is fun.  Kind of a hard recommend if you haven't already played Persona 5 as you will be in the dark in quite a lot of details especially character relationships and words like \"Metaverse\" or \"Palace.\"  I would definitely recommend if you already played Persona 5 and are open to action rpg games.  7.5/10\n\nAlso Atlus just put P5 on steam already.  Why the sequel got here first I will never understand.",

It was a really amazing ride and took me around 50 hours to beat. \nAnd well I'll be listing some pros and cons as well as some personal \"feelings\" down the end. Keep in mind, I'll only list the really important parts in this review. SPOILER FREE REVIEW! \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n[b] * Good story [/b]\nThe story in this game is pretty damn good and works perfectly as a sequel. \nThe Phantom Thieves reunite again to steal the hearts and desires of even more adults on a \"roadtrip.\" That's about what I can say without spoilers. \n\n[b] * The gameplay and 60fps! [/b]\nUnlike all the other Persona games, this one isn't turnbased. It's a hack and slash type of game, but it does it kinda differently. You'll still have to hit the enemies' weaknesses to do more damage and stun them, meaning you still have to think, it'll just be a bit more action-paced. And the combat is also really satisfying. Oh. Did I mention that this game is actually in 60fps? No 30fps cap. \n\n[b] * Visuals and cutscenes look better than they've ever been! [/b]\n[b] * The level design [/b]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] * The repetitive story. [/b]\nThis story is really good! But! This Persona game does like every other Persona game, it keeps the same formular in the story. For example, in Persona 5/Royal you go and infiltrate palaces, but most of the palaces are made for you to get another teammate on your team. While this game doesn't exactly do this, it does it in a similar way. You go to jail, turn the shadow good, and then leave again, only to do the same process over and over. While this ain't THAT bad, I really hope that the future Persona games will improve on this. This is why the last bosses in Persona are always so good, because they're so different. \n\n[b] * No social links [/b]\nMakes sense, since this is a very linear game in comparison to Persona 5. Still, I've always loved the social aspect of the Persona series. Sucks that it ain't here since it's what made Persona 5 into my favorite game. \n\n[h1] Thoughts [/h1]\nI really enjoyed this game and I think it's a GREAT sequel. (With a few flaws.) If you love the Persona games (or just love Persona 5) You'll like this game, 100%! It might not be AS good as Persona 5/Royal, but it's still worth playing!",

The musou style gameplay brings a breath of fresh air to the Persona series, mixing in hack and slash elements with the unique mechanics of Persona. Being able to play it on PC was a plus point. Looking forward to more Persona 5 games or Persona games on PC!",

No cat telling me that I should go to bed.\n\nBut the story to me felt so unsatisfying. It was ok in a sense of \"hey that was a good time\" but it lacked those memorable moments that we loved in royal/vanilla, it was like a ONS instead of a worth while reunion.\nWould still recommend this if you're a p5 or a persona fan in general. \n\nAction style persona game was definitely a great experience.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an ARPG triumph and hopefully a template for more SMT action RPGs in the future (it's been too long since the Raidou games).  They took the rough Dynasty Warriors/Musou template, merged with the SMT framework and Persona 5 specific features (baton passes, One More attacks, etc), loaded up each Phantom Thief with a moveset unique and fitting to them, and set you loose.  Combat is fast and fluid, while still being tactical and having that SMT lethality that you expect.  On an overall systems level, they kept what made sense from the base game, while removing or replacing bits that wouldn't make sense (ex. Social links, strict time scheduling).  The result is a game that's paced well, has a lot of challenging and fun encounters, but rewards your growth and skill over time (and your ability to fuse personas with elemental drains and physical/gun attack skills in tandem).\n\nPlotwise, P5S is a direct sequel to Persona 5 (Royal content notwithstanding) and follows a similar enough trajectory as bit of a mirror to the Phantom Thieves' previous Metaverse adventures.  Strikers has the Phantom Thieves go on a summer road trip around Japan dealing with mysterious Jails that are appearing in concert with minor change of heart outbreaks.  In short, it's exactly what you'd expect from your favorite loudmouthed idiot social reformers on vacation, with some hilarious moments and the usual levels of \"Morgana makes stuff up about the Metaverse that ends up being accurate\".  Haru in particular is a riot due to not being saddled with the worst introduction plotline in the base game, and the new additions to the roster fit right into the group dynamic.  P5S won't break any new ground, but if you finished Persona 5 and want to spend more time with this group of miscreants, you'll have a good time with them here.\n\nAll in all, more than worth the money for SMT/P5 fans; if you're not familiar with P5 but are intrigued by this and don't mind some spoilers to the base game, it's still worth a look.",

Although I appreciate ATLUS adding this game to pc, the pc controls are hot garbage and awkward to use without rebinding over half of them.\n2. The buttons on the switch pro controller are all jumbled up. You can fix this, again, by rebinding your buttons to the correct layout but you shouldn't have to do this to make your game enjoyable to play. This also changes the visual ques on the screen. If you're already familiar with the game then it's not a problem. But I get confused when the screen tells me to do one thing but the button does something else.\n\nOverall I think the story is good and the game play and mechanics would be good if the controls worked the way they're supposed to. Unless you have an Xbox controller, then none of this really matters then. But I don't so I'm going to complain.",

        "content": "Hi, I really looked forward to playing this game. Can't recommend it after 10 hours, though. I don't want to continue this. Note: I have not played Persona before, but have watched it on Twitch regularly and roughly know the plot. Also, I'll try to be the devil's advocate here, but don't blame me if I get a little worked up.\nPros:\nThere's no doubt it has awesome cinematics, cool fighting mechanics and controls well. I like Anime. Occasionally, I'll watch one. It's tiring though, how in every new Anime, most of the same ideas always get recycled. Persona, on the other hand, does a good job to come up with interesting new ideas and the characters all have a unique charme to them.\nThe palaces are really fun. I like the hidden chests and objects, the relatively unique combat ideas and the Persona system.\nI played the game on normal mode and it is very well balanced. Plus, the music is great. I do believe some people are overrating the music, but it's still really spicy.\nCons:\nHear me out; I already mentioned that I like Anime. I, too, can invest lots of my time into deeper story and plot analysis. However, if I wanted to play a visual novel, I just would've. The dialogue scenes are cool at first, but they get so boring. At the same time, neither have any of my dialogue 'decisions' made ANY difference on the plot whatsoever, nor am I really willing to completely 'skip' all of them since then I'd have no idea what's going on. And the plot is what people always praise the series for, innit? I don't think it's bad to have long dialogue sequences, but they really OVERDID IT with the frequency. I've spent less time in dialogue sequences in all Life Is Strange games that have been released...\nFurthermore, one is SO limited! I can't underscore this enough. You can't even explore one shop, one sideroad, one small area without any of the characters becoming professor oak lamenting about it 'neither being the right place, nor time'. I have to strictly follow the game's idea of how it wants to be played. It's frustrating. Why, devs? Well, in Pokemon Red (1999) at leat you could enter Pokemarts. Well, ATLUS didn't even bother to animate that in 2021. Again, where is the love? If the game is set in Tokyo, at least try to make it feel like there's a cool shopping experience you can have. The food and medical items you can buy in Persona 5 Strikers are basically all the same (When it comes to TP and SP restoring), they just have different names. By the way, 'Donut-Worry' (restores some health) is the only item/thing in the game that has made me chuckle. Though likeable, the convos are never really... funny. Yeah, the don't have a good sense of humour.\nThe areas are well designed. The artwork and visuals fit perfectly. In Tokyo and other places like Sendai, however, you'll see the same 9-10 character models all the time. Humans in this game appear to be nothing but strange hollows without even a glimpse of a soul. I just really wish they (the devs) had spent more time creating a world that's actually vivid. I wish they had taken more time to make this a good game.\nThe skill tree in this game is ridiculously uncomplex (It's the complete opposite to a game like Final Fantasy X). It's not interesting, it's not individual, and it's not really challenging your decisionmaking/brain either. Heck, they don't even make you do a small minigame or the like when you cook for the rest of the party. \nHyrule Warrios, for anyone who's played that, really sucks at the plot part. But at least I get to PLAY the GAME. And I don't want to wait until I've gained freedom of movement potentially towards the end game. That's simply not a point.\nWe're in 2021 and still nobody expects your game to be as detailed as, say, the Witcher III (2015). In Contrast, with games like The Witcher existing (not a 60 Euro title by the way), how can you even legitimize putting so few love into your towns that you could basically copy from reality and didn't have to make up entirely.\nConclusion:\nI have to add, that the voice acting in this game is superb and the writing too. As english is my second language, I quite enjoy the narrative and style. To be honest, I could probably forget about the cons. Well, if this weren't a 60 Euro game, that is!\nI bought this game on Sale (52 Euro for Digital Deluxe) and that wasn't even worth it. I think at it's current state, the game isn't worth any more than 25 Euro, for there is a huge lack in love for the design of player independence. And hence they try to make it seem like your decision matters in conversations, you can't tell me they're not actually trying to establish the illusion that you do have some independence in this game.\nSince I'm done with school now, soon to be studying at university and thus am short on money, I'll have to continue this game. I merely don't have the money to buy another one. I'll come back to this review once finished. \nIf at all, please keep the comments neutral and respectful. Try convincing me rather than defending your favorite nostalgic franchise.",

        "content": "[h1] Actual, Super-Serious Persona 5 Strikers Review: [/h1]\n\n[strike] it's ok, i guess. [/strike]\n\n\n\nTL;DR: It's a good game, and I don't recommend it for those who haven't played/experienced Persona 5 in any form or fashion.\n\n\n\nP5S is a great sequel for both the base and the Royal re-release versions of Persona 5. Admittedly I [i] am [/i] biased, as I fell in love with this game series since Royal's release and quarantine's abundance of free time. \n\nIt has more of the characters that you love and more of the strategies you employed in P5, all wrapped up with fast-paced hack n' slash gameplay and a decent story that adds new characters that I'll refrain from mentioning any further. If this is your first game with the Phantom Thieves, I sincerely recommend that you [i] not [/i] start here, as all the pre-existing characters are already established in this sequel, and the game wastes [i] no [/i] time re-introducing them or their character arcs. If you don't understand what's going on from the beginning, you'll have to catch up on a lot in your own time, or just run around like a headless chicken and beat the h#%l out of the computer pixels with your skillful excellent button pressing.\n\nMy first run-through of mastering the game (Finishing the story and completing [b] all [/b] of the requests, side-bosses, etc.) took me exactly 69 [spoiler] nice [/spoiler] hours and so-and-so minutes on Hard mode, though I certainly took my time.\n\nI also went through a Merciless NG+ run (only available after Mastering your first run) to finish my achievements list and unlock more powerful [strike] psychological Pok\u00e9mon [/strike] Personas, I finished the achievement list at my current playtime (130.0 hours). While I do love this game, I'm not the type to normally enjoy NG+ runs and that more or less remains the same. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you [i] absolutely [/i] thought the game was too easy. Though be warned, it may feel a lot grindier than the normal Easy/Normal/Hard mode runs.\n\nOther notable things worth mentioning:\n[list]\n[*]I only played on controller, and I recommend you do the same if possible. I'm not familiar with MnK controls, though I hear they're not the best. That preference is up to you, of course.\n[*]The music, as always, is a banger. And has been remixed to fit with this game's faster, more action-oriented combat.\n[*]The fusion system, the Velvet Room, and obtaining masks work somewhat differently compared to P5/P5R, though personally I didn't find the changes of serious significance.\n[*]There are [i] no [/i] Confidants/Social Links, in its place are the traditional RPG-like leveling up of skills, and Combat Mastery by playing different Phantom Thieves.\n[*]Speaking of which, you're able to play as any of the Phantom Thieves almost immediately. Each member has their own special variation of combos, and a unique combat skill that can alter your approach to a fight.\n[*]Unfortunately, no waifu is canon. But (actual semi-spoiler) [spoiler] a certain 5head bestgirl(?) may or may not get more screentime [/spoiler]. \n[/list]\n\n\nAll in all, Persona 5 Strikers burned my bread, revealed the troof, and stole my heart. I lost the mutual respect of my friend groups after they saw me jump into the Persona sinkhole, and after 100%'ing this game I can tell you I've only sunk in further.",

Plus I really like hack and slash type games, like Metal Gear Rising and Bayonetta. This however, is neither of those.\n\nThis game is a mix of Persona 5 and Musou games. If you like Musou games, you will probably like this, if you don't, but you enjoy persona 5, you might still enjoy it, given that it does differentiate in some aspects\n\nIt plays like persona 5 in the sense that you get to wield personas and it adds a somewhat complex layer to the game\nHowever,  it's pretty boring as far as action games go. It's an average at best game covered with persona 5 elements that makes it seem better than it actually is.\n\n It lacks the polish most persona games have. The bad guys are bland, the main cast interactions feel sameish all throughout the game, the side missions are tedious as all hell, honestly it's a very unrewarding experience. There is no calendar system, there is no confidants, the difficulty is inconsistent... It's just not persona, or a fun game for that matter.\n\nIt's not good. It's not bad either, it's just ok! Not worth the $60 price tag, get it on sale.\n\n\n\n \n\n",

The game duration should be around 40-50 hours, but the story is really good and worth its attention. For casual players, it is recommended (specially if you played P5 vanilla) a lot of fun and the combat system is fair enough. Adding new characters that have good characterization and development. Something to add... the music is awesome. The new additions and the remastered versions of the old ones are just better. Anyway, long story short, the game has a good narrative, good game-play along with the awesome music, and amazing addition of new characters.",

I played persona 5 strikers and I am pretty much the main character but in real life , so I decided to do things he did to make friends/girlfriends. I started by making a social link chart and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside. I'm pretty far in my social links with the girls in the apartment next door probably 6/7 with both of them . I left them a calling card too to let them know I was going to steal their hearts I know in the game if you date multiple girls is bad but I have until valentine's Day to figure that out. Discord servers are like mementos where I can dive and debate with people until I improve the worldview of that server that's like public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too . When I get 100% I think they'll give me mod on the server",

        "content": "So I really like the Persona series and am planning on getting SMT Nocturne when it comes to steam. I will fully admit that I am biased toward this series and ATLUS in general. So instead of listing reasons you should get this game I will do a Pro/Con/Depends list.\n\nPros: \n- Killer Soundtrack\n- Fun Hack & Slash Gameplay\n- Good Variety of Characters and Playstyles\n- Persona fusing has been changed. It now shows specific recipes for personas, even personas you don't yet own.   \n\nCons:\n- Combat/Combos/Abilities take time to learn and you will be going back to the tutorial menu when you forget which combo casts Zio. \n- No Igor or Akechi :(\n- I'll admit I'm struggling with coming up with cons, but I recommend looking at my next list to see if this game is right for you.\n\nDepends:\n- Direct sequel to Persona 5. This leaves a nice place for players to return to, but could alienate new players. It is worth mentioning that I tried my best to notice when the game made reference to the original P5 and it wasn't super frequent.\n- Shorter than most RPGs. My first run was ~55  hours. Keep in mind I did every side quest I could.\n\nHopefully this encouraged you to get the game. Overall, very fun hack and slash game that I had a hell of a time with. Don't go in looking for something super groundbreaking. Instead go in for a fun, flashy and fantastical game where a bunch of kids go on a road trip. Takes some getting used to, but if my goldfish brain can have fun with this game, so can you.",

It's more relatable and the motives of the villains make you question whether or not you're in the right. From a different perspective, you could even say the phantom thieves are in the wrong in some instances.\n\ngreat experience, 10/10\nleft me with a little bit less depression after I beat it than royal did (which makes sense because royal was more than 2x longer) but still really made me sit there and appreciate the credits.\n\nthanks atlus for finally bringing this over to the west :)",

It really feels like a natural sequel to the first game which was super nice to come back to characters I loved. I will say the gameplay is super iffy.\n\nAt times, its a super fun and competent action rpg. The whole \"warriors\" type games are not my cup of tea but they did a good job making the whole game feel like its not made by that company.\n\nHowever they didn't do a good job explaining mechanics of how the action and jrp persona battle mixes in. The game can either be painfully easy or huge diffuculty spikes of trial and error which isn't fun.\n\nPlus the whole thing where characters you dont use dont level up with you until late game is really bad design. They did it in the last game and Royal so I don't understand why they don't do it for this game.\n\nHowever its a really good game, I just feel the style of game should had either tweaked it a bit more to fit it, or just stayed as a turn based jrpg.\n\nalso put persona 5 on steam and switch you cowards.",

Mouse Camera control has some Acceleration but not a big deal for me. Good thing is you can disable the Auto-Camera (love this option! but it's still have some Auto Center Camera on some Action which is pretty lame)\n\nNote: Lots of dialogue. could be boring for player who hates long down-time. but you can skip/Fast-FWD most of them.\n\n[update: 21 hours-in]\nThe game screen constantly filled with Chat bubbles, Onomatopoeia (comic effect words), and many type of Anime/Comic Effects. it's quite Messy. I know it's their Theme but it's too messy IMO.\n\nGameplays: \n[u]Combat[/u]:\nHard to tell when to dodge (partly cause how messy the effects on screen)\nYou fight with a Party of 1-4 Characters and can switch between them on-the-fly.\nBut in the end, it boils down to Spamming - Press Action when prompt and Repeat. pretty bare bone.\n\n[u]RPG aspect[/u]:\nYou can collect Persona and Fusion them to evolve (somewhat like Pok\u00e9mon) and they have 8 skill slots. They learn more skills and get stronger stats as they leveled up. Main Character (Joker) can switch between several Persona of choice while the Companions have their own fixed Persona.\n\nThe item system is overall pretty awful. the game have small list of Weapons, Armors, Accessories, Consumables. it's a pain to run around looking for the item stores and Vending machine, wasting time and 0 fun.\n\n[u]Summary[/u]\nThe Story each chapter feel pretty much the same. \n1. You go to one town.  2. There's a bad guy. 3. You talk to a few NPC to collect information so you can go to next step. Buy items around the town. \n4. Enter the Jail (Palace dimension) to beat up Mobs, Collect a few orbs.\n5. Come back out to fight 1 mini-boss.\n6. Go back to fight Main boss. and Move on to next town.\n7. Repeat 1-7 for several chapters\n\nThe game is getting Dull over time. but the Style does make some good screenshots too bad there's no Photo Mode. \n\nNot a great / Not terrible game.

        "content": "I bought it again despite already having it on Switch thanks to the sale, and I must admit the 60FPS my gaming laptop can muster makes the game feel suprisingly different in a good way!\n\nThe game already means a lot to me as the whole setting and idea pretty much broke the chains I had been bound upon in my head by myself during the ongoing pandemic. It even learned me how to control my subconcious mind better along the way.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. Makes good use of the Persona system and translates it to real-time combat rather than turn-based and even the music remixes are made to complement the change perfectly well! It also just plays a lot better than most Warriors games, with more focus on story to balance out the often repetitive gameplay of these kinda games. It builds more upon a world and its exploration, rather than the 'Select a battle' style most Warriors games have nowadays.\n\nWant a game that can hit you in the feels, and have a amazing soundtrack to go with it along with many other things to love in a RPG, then give this game a go for sure. Switch, Steam, both are good in their own ways.\n\nOh, and finally: Persona 3 (FES), Persona 5 Royal or just the whole Persona series for Switch and Steam when? I'm not asking this like many others are at every single chance to do so, this is even my first time doing it like this. Persona as a series, despite having watched more playthroughs than actually having played it, still really helped me understand myself more as the games show the way people work very well. Persona 4 touches upon acceptance of yourself and your bad sides, Persona 5 Strikers then goes deeper into that idea and instead goes for the way people become due to traumas or other events they might've gone through in the past and can't let go off.\n\nSo another point: If you feel you're struggling with these things, give the series a go (Or a look) and don't take everything at face value. The games have a weird way of showing off the Human mind, but it's actually not all that far-fetched if you really think about.",

        "content": "Worth it at $40 if you like persona 5.\n\nStrikers is fun and good, it suffers from repetition though. Starting with the good:\n\nStory's relatively straightforward, but good enough to keep you strung along. I'm about two thirds of the way through it, so maybe the last bit will blow me out of the water. If you like road trips and mysteries, you might like it.\n\nGraphics/sound/presentation are all amazing. Nothing takes you out of the game, and the music really serves the fights well. Only issues is that you will hear some soundtracks too many times, and there's no ultrawide support :(\n\nGameplay is where it gets interesting. Imagine hyrule warriors but every enemy has elemental strengths and weaknesses, and you can collect enemies like pokemon and fuze them into different, stronger fighters (called personas). There's also basic enviromental attacks that do elemental damage. Add switching between characters as well, and the result is good fun. There's an additional amount of depth in technicals, ailments, buffs/debuffs, but you don't really need to focus on them, even in hard mode. \n\nThe problem is that it, like other warrior esc games, it gets repetitive. Boss battles are supposed to freshen it up, but they mostly fight like other enemies but with quicker attacks and bigger health bars. So, you're gonna do a lot of swinging, casting a spell at a weakness, and dodging regardless of the fight, and not much else. It really would benefit with much more emphasis on inflicting technicals/ailments and switching to different personas/party members to deal damage. Then each fight requires using your brain a bit instead of how it currently is. \n\nUnlike persona 5, there's not much side stuff to do, so there isn't really much to take a break from the combat. Side quests boil down to doing combat challenges, fetching items for party members, or both. A lot of them require you backtrack through previous dungeons too. This game is really only playable for the main story.\n\nIt's still fun and I enjoy it, can't see it being worth $60 though. Wait for a good sale.",

        "content": "I have beaten this game twice. While it may not have been on the steam version, I am working on that right now.\nPersona 5/Royal is my favorite game of all time. So when Atlus released this, I was exited as hell. I will now say a few things my sister has asked me about it (Also a persona fan)\nWorthy Sequal? Yes\nAs good as original or Royal? Close but no\nWorth it to play on anything its available on? Some better than others but overall yes.\n\nNow onto the actual spoiler-free Review.\nWhile it is different from the Turn-Based battles of the series, it's still a very good game. As I have played some hack and slash games, While I may be a bit biased on this decision, Persona 5 Strikers is my favorite of that genera due to the characters, story, and overall feeling of the fighting. Its nice to have different abilities and still have it feeling like the main series. I still highly recommend playing P5/R before playing P5S if you can.\nThe controls are easy to understand. I personally played with a controller as thats what I use for hack and slash and persona games in general. (Xbox One and Switch Pro Controller for more background) While I dont think its impossible to play with a keyboard and mouse, it would be harder as you only have 8 ways to move. But play how you want to or have the ability to play with.\nOverall, Recommended. With a few aceptions. If you have played or watched a full playthrough of P5/R.",

This game doesn't mention anything that happened in Royal so don't worry about Royal if you haven't played it. If you're into action RPGs or Dynasty Warriors, you're in for a ride just don't expect Social Links and all that. The game is repetitive but at the same time I did not mind at all. The Phantom Thieves were already lovable characters and this game makes you love them even more plus Sophia and Zenkichi (gramps) are the best additions to the Phantom Thieves. My only flaw of this game is that why doesn't Ann or Makoto forget that I romanced them smh \n\nPlease give us Persona 5 Royal, Persona 3, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and the dancing games this is too much but I spend big bucks on it anyways even if I'm broke. :)",

The ability to change characters and fight with different styles helps keep the combat a little bit fresh. You might get bored of repetitive combat but it goes by fast. Getting the bonus BGM from the deluxe edition helped with fights to add more variety too but that is more money to be spent.\n\nI did not have any crashing problems as I played like other people seem to have had, the most recent patch might have fixed that. Some of the CG cut scenes in the beginning had some crusty frame rate but towards the end I noticed it got better. Gameplay was smooth the entire time. \n\nI paid $76 USD for the deluxe edition. I felt like it was worth it for myself, as I am becoming increasingly invested in the persona games. If you're just a casual fan that is not super invested then maybe getting it at $40 or $50 might feel better for you.\n\nIt is a direct sequel to Persona 5 though, so you might want to play that beforehand. Currently, Persona 5 / Royal is only available on the playstation. Hopefully Atlus will port Persona 5 to PC later on.",

        "content": "I have beaten the game and all I say is Atlus has done it again. They brought us a epic game called Persona 5 not once not twice but three times and all of them are great Persona 5 Great game and Great combat system, Persona 5 Royal same game as Persona 5 but with more to story and new combat types, and Persona 5 Scramble (Strikers) completely new combat system and still nailed it. \n\nThere were few problems with the combat like how some fights you can easily get stun locked and die. The Bonds could have used a bit more work some of them feel like they don't do anything. The Story was great as always with Atlus games. The side quests or as they are known in game as \"Requests\" is a brilliant idea I loved doing them even though some of them seem a bit grindy. The two new characters they added to the persona 5 roster are great (thats all I can say without saying any spoilers). \n\nOver all I say this game is brilliant 10/10 would always play again!~",

        "content": "Spoiler free.\n\nI think its been stated multiple times, but you MUST play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before you play this game. Well, I shouldn't say \"must\" but the impact and fan service in this title is so spectacular if you've played the first entry in the series. Without it, you will 100% be missing out, both on specific story sections, and character (further) development.\n\nLet it also be noted that this game appears to follow Persona 5 more than Persona 5 Royal, due to missing added characters from P5R and specific portraits pulled from P5 rather than P5R. P5R also had a couple story changes, but nothing that should make you want to play P5 over P5R. Pick either one, play it, and then play this amazing game. Don't let the Musou battle system scare you away. This battle system is miles better than anything Dynasty Warriors has done since its creation.\n\n+ The Battle system is fun and skillful. Each character has abilities to learn and unlock and a specific playstyle. Each playstyle can be extremely useful or largely abused (against you) depending on which and what type of enemy you are fighting\n+ Tons and tons of Personas for our Protagonist, just like in P5/P5R\n+ Throbbing King of Desire returns. If you're not sure about this reference, avoid looking it up in public\n+ Great story. Great Characters. Same feeling and writing style from P5/P5R\n+ Same great music\n+ Post game content\n+ Returning entity from P3 (don't look it up)\n\n- Save Often. Crashes from time to time/infinite loading screens. I think the 1.02 patch fixed most of this (at the time of posting this review 4/27/21) as I was having much less crashing upon it's implementation, but not entirely resolved.",

        "content": "Truly remarkable continuation of beloved Persona 5. Strikers is a direct sequel to the last entry of Persona series made by Atlus in terms of plot. However the genre this time is different which mostly reflects in combat, which has moved from classic turn-based style to ripping and tearing dozens of enemies at once. The game is as stylish as its predecessor, but not as complex and long. The characters we all know and love remain such through the whole playthrough. In addition we get two completely new companions, who are an excellent addition to the famous cast. Persona 5 Strikers is a roller coaster of emotions from start to finish. Definitely recommend this product to anyone who's familiar with the series and is open to some innovations.",

This game will definitely be confusing story-wise if you haven't played the original Persona 5 seeing as there are plenty of references to it's predecessor.\n\n*Slight Story Spoilers*\n\nThe game follows the same story structure as Persona 5, and will leave any players who played the previous vanilla Persona or Royal with a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu  by the time you get to the climax and ending. And of course, the story uses the very traditional character trope where there is an abnormal teammate who does not know who or what they are (Used in both Persona 4 Golden with 2 characters, and with Morgana in Persona 5). If these story beats do not deter you, and you like the warriors style combat, you'll enjoy this game overall as I did.",

        "content": "It's Persona 5's sequel - Lite Edition.\n\nThe gameplay is very much like Persona 5's, with a lot of the same. The game is still split in 2 sections, the Metaverse and the  real world. \n\nThe gameplay in the Metaverse is mostly the same as Persona 5's, except for the combat. You'll navigate around, hide in corners and ambushing enemies the same, but instead of turn-based combat it's a Dynasty Warriors style. The fights don't span the entire map like other entries in the genre, but are instead in small, restricted areas. Most of the Persona fight aspects are still there, using Personas to attack, taking advantage of elements, all out attacks, and the like. Ambushes against weaker enemies usually ends up with an immediate All-Out-Attack and winning immediately, though tougher fights do take more time as expected. While fighting, you have 3 teammates with you, which you can control both in fights and while exploring the dungeons. Each teammate has a unique playstyle too.\n\nIn the real world, things are very dialed back compared to the full Persona games. There are no Confidants/Social Links, and most of the confidants from 5 are gone, but not unmentioned. There are no romance options, either. There's no stats to build. There's no time limit on completing the dungeons, you are free to leave and re-enter them as much as you want as opposed to progressing to the next day as is usual. Most of your time in the real world is spent either shopping for items, completing tasks for rewards like new weapons, or just doing story-related tasks such as getting info on the next dungeon boss.\n\nThe story itself I have not completed, but from what I have played it is very enjoyable. The game is very much a sequel to Persona 5, the original version, not Royal. It's nice to come back to the Phantom Thieves.\n\nOverall, while the Metaverse side is quite fun and familiar, the real world side feels lacking and leaves me wanting more. However, I'd still recommend this game. It's still a fun game and the team is as enjoyable as ever, but playing the game makes me want to revisit Persona 5.",

        "content": "A fantastic continuation of the P5 story, though you'll need to have played the original Persona 5 (on PS3) or Royal (on PS4/5) to understand what is going on at all -- as of writing, there's no native PC versions of those games. so maybe hold off on buying this until you find a way to play those.\nStory-wise, the game is more of the same, at least at a glance. Go into Metaverse and change the hearts of villains. However, there are a few twists and turns regarding it this time around that significantly change how it feels, but I will not spoil the specifics.\nIn terms of gameplay, well, this is an action game, not a turn-based RPG. Despite that, it's an excellent translation of traditional Persona gameplay into this new genre. However, you need to be ready to actually rely on melee attacks and items instead of just spamming spells this time around, because the game will drain your SP like there's no tomorrow otherwise.\nAs far as social links are concerned, well, there are none. This is understandable, since you are supposed to already know the characters well enough for this not to be necessary. There are still a few optional sidequests that offer little bits and pieces of character development here and there, but for the most part the game is focused on the main story -- that's not to say that no development occurs [i]during[/i] said main story, though: it certainly does, especially for the new characters.\nAlso, Sophie very cute.",

        "content": "9/10. The story is a bit of a repeat at certain parts for people who have played Persona 5 but the core of it is fresh. Music is perfect as always. Gameplay is fun and new game plus provides a challenge while allowing players to use their personas they built from playthrough 1 (persona series needs more of this). Overall a great addition to the series despite what \"Atlus keeps milking this\" fanboys say. After 60+ hours the verdict is, if you like persona and you like hack and slash, it's a must buy.",

Lots of what Persona usually is (turn based fights, a bunch of stats, timing things, looking up a guide to make sure you can get the best ending) isn't here, and that's totally fine- instead you get a linear story with ONE ENDING with the usual persona kind of stuff, and real-time battles, which persona abilities actually flow rather well into. Instead of confidant bars, you have an overall meter that seems to gain points based on progression and your dialogue options that gives you points to put into whatever effects you want, like increased yen gain, increased item drop, etc.\n\nIt seems fine, but, I was only able to play through the entire first jail before I started getting blackscreens and crashes upon trying to enter the second one. Now it won't even load up, so I can't really judge the whole of it. A fix did get released recently, but, I was actually able to load in before, now I can't even do that.",

I think that this game is pretty neat, I wouldn't have had put as many hours as i have put into it if I didn't enjoy it. \n\nParts of the game could have been better, though a lot of my criticisms have been already addressed by a lot of people though I'll say that how leaving the dungeon and coming back to restore hp and more importantly sp is kinda dumb that it just doesn't heal automatically, I guess its to have the feeling of during new game plus or whatever the player can feel like they didn't need to come back and rejuvenate but doesn't really feel like its needed aside from possibly needing to stock up on items which could just be done anyways.\n\nThe story is fine I liked parts of it can't say I'm too much of a fan though even if it is just mostly dumb fun, I like some of the new characters but that's about it. \n\nThe game would crash on me a unusual amount of times for almost no explainable reason, I detected a pattern some of the time with like traveling between the velvet room and back or like leaving the game on in the background for a realllllly long time and then it would crash after some transition back to the real world, but other times i really couldn't explain why like during story events, so I just got used to save somewhat often since it barely takes that much time.\n\nI got a unusual amount of time trying to assemble some heavy hitting personas (even if lucifer is just the best for dealing with large groups) and figuring out a lot of the different combos that come with those personas and even different party members, its all built pretty well. In the case of joker though being able to switch out to a persona that nulls or absorbs a attack was pretty satisfying though it also kinda feels like there's not really a reason not to freeze time to null a attack instead of like dodging or something, due to how most attacks don't really move when you freeze time and select a different persona, aside from some attacks acting during that time but barely ever happens. I think if a sequel or a different SMT spin off as there could be a lot to expand on here gameplay wise. \n\nIf you like this series there's not really a reason to not get the game but just gonna say I'd wait for a discount because despite all the good I don't think its worth 60 bucks, and I especially don't think it was worth 70 bucks even if I got to access it 3 days early and some music dlc/extras which in all honesty ain't much : P (Or you could just buy it anyways). ~~I'm sure I'll complain about the price of things more as soon as nocturne hd comes out~~",

Atlus and Koei really made this game work amazingly, perfectly translating the persona 5 battles into warriors style. The game just as stylish and the writing is just as good, if not better then Royals. All the new music and remixs feel great and unique while still feeling the same. Although the game has some issues running on PC, it still runs well enough to play. The Digital Deluxe in-game DLC I find really adds to the game having the older music from the series' past. Although the Deluxe's bonus content is just a unity project, which means you don't get the soundtrack directly as music files. Atlus actually updating this game on PC to make it more stable is great, just wish they'd fix the optimization issues it has.",

        "hours": 4845,
        "content": "I wasn't convinced about an action-based Persona game, but having completed it, I couldn't have asked for a better spin-off.\n\nThe game previews show Joker facing off against massive swarms of enemies, giving the wrong impression of a musou-like hack-and-slash. Those big brawls are there, but most mob fights are far more similar to a traditional persona confrontation, against a handful (around 10) enemies with different weaknesses, and we could always pause the action by holding down the right bumper, so it's a real-time with pause action game.\n\nEverything takes place within the summer holidays, so Strikers is shorter in both story and character development, but the main cast is as likable as ever. The timeline is a direct continuation from the original P5, but it's somewhat jarring that the other characters seem to have forgotten their relationship (if any) with Joker. Also, considering that the Phantom Thieves are already embedded in the public consciousness and they're stirring up quite a storm this time, it's awkward to not hear a single peep from their outer circle of confidants. The Mishima we know would have gone ballistic from the stuff they're doing this time around.\n\nGameplay-wise, party members mostly reprise their original roles in P5. For example, Skull is still a powerhouse in boss fights; he's actually better than Joker until Joker's personas are fully developed. Mona is still a reliable wind hitter / heal battery, and he can transform into his van form to road rage into enemies again and again. Fox's playstyle centers around countering single physical hits with his own, and a few members can imbue their normal hits with their native element, bypassing physical resistance or immunity. Ammo fully regenerates after every fight. Noir (when mastered) can shoot for free, and certain members have ways to replenish mid-fight.\n\nThis time around, the Personas and fusion system are a bit more interesting. Having come from the original P3 and P4, it was far too easy in P5 (and P4G) to put any skill into any persona, rendering the nuance in inheritance slot limitations, elemental restrictions, and multiple fusions completely moot. I'm pretty sure everyone's glad that random inheritance is gone, but P5's system made it such that personas without unique skills are only as good as their innate resistances or growth potential i.e. the lower their initial level, the better, so many personas that start at high level, e.g. Messiah and many arcana capstones, are no good. It made no sense.\n\nIn this game, there are no personas locked behind DLC, and on top of the 8 skill slots, each persona has up to 3 combo skills that cost no SP or HP. These are innate to each persona, and they restore personas' much-needed identity. For example, want to combo into a free maziodyne? Thor is our only pick. Mara has its own unique combo-only severe fire skill called maralagidyne. Skill cards are still there, but they cannot modify these combo skills, and the best ones only drop at the very end of the post-game of NG+, so if we want good personas earlier on, especially when just going into Risky / Merciless difficulty, fusion is the way to go. There's also no limit on persona stat growth, so if we have the resources, there's no problem enhancing all stats to 99.\n\nDefense passives such as absorb element that are traditionally extremely powerful in turn-based persona, are not very relevant here, because we could just switch to another persona at any time. Enemy moves are clearly telegraphed, and baton pass, showtime, as well as all-out attacks all confer generous iframes, on top of dodge roll. That's before factoring in the omnipotent orb. It's a very interesting change-up in terms of how an end-game persona is supposed to look like.\n\nThere's also surprisingly little grind in this game, which is really welcome. I'm sitting at 100% completion with about 100 hours on my file from just playing through normally, and Joker's personas and four other members are already all maxed out. If you want to max everyone's stats with incenses, that will take a few hours fighting the reaper on Merciless difficulty (he drops 75 incenses in one go). Or if you absolutely need some skill card, e.g. any drain card. For that, good luck, because some of the drop rates are really, really low.\n\nAs for things that could be improved, a persona's combo moves aren't shown in the compendium, so the only way to know is to try them out or look them up. Analog movement is also really iffy even when using a controller; your character is locked into 8 directions of movement. It's bad when moving around, but surprisingly enough, it doesn't get in the way during fights.\n\nAs a separate issue, once Joker's personas get powerful enough, it becomes possible to just endlessly stunlock most bosses by inflicting burn, freeze, or shock, and then literally just doing hassou tobi / vacuum wave over and over with knockdown style and technical adept. That's... a really boring way to play the game, but it's also the fastest way to bring down the boss. That's no good.\n\nHere's to a simultaneous PC release for P6, eh Atlus? Maybe include a difficulty option to disable skill cards for fusion purists.\n\nA few tips for Risky / Merciless difficulty: Start with at least a good persona or two, e.g. Yoshi, and max Navi's HP first, for the defense sections. The best way to spawn treasure demons for money and skill cards is to just move around or change zones when alert level is in the red, after clearing at least one group. They have a distinctive way of scooting around the minimap, and they give off a continuous tinkle even when not in line of sight. In the final dungeon, treasure demons give 750k yen with the money accessory, and you should be able to get one to spawn every 5 minutes or less. Dire shadows are best for bond points. For PP, just keep enhancing and dismissing the same persona over and over.\n\n\nBottom line: Don't miss this if you're a persona fan.",

It literally feels like Persona 5 like all the characters you were friends with going on a road trip across Japan. I didn't think the sequel of Persona 5 would be good, but it turned out amazing af. They added new characters in the game that I truly fell in love with throughout the story. This is the game that tbh everybody has good character and I liked all them.  Indeed was a good game I thought I would hate the fact that the game is not Turn-based like the original Persona, BUT honestly I like the fighting mode better when I actually played it. Because you get through \"jail\"(which is the P5:Striker's Palaces) is so much easier than palaces in the OG Persona. The fighting is also pretty sick. Even the soundtracks are as amazing as the OG Persona 5. You know the GAME is good when I played it everyday when I got it, or waiting after doing work and playing it. So far my favorite quarantine game to escape from reality",

The story is detailed and great. I personally skip it sometimes because it's a ton of dialogue but the content is quality and human. Great game to relax.\nThe moves are simple and fun the brawling and mechanism feel perfectly integrated with the rpg elements and the world plus the story make it all for a very immersive experience.\n\nI still prefer Persona 5 though hopefully they port that to PC. I already have it on console but It's way too convenient being able to play persona on just my laptop PLEASE DO THIS NOW",

It really does have that Person 5 feel. There are some differences with combat being the biggest so far but I feel like i havent even dipped my toes in the story yet so ill finish the review after i complete the game.",

The gameplay is fun and all the characters feel distinct enough, on the harder difficulties you have to think about what skills to use and when which adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay.\nThe plot is nothing spectacular but it's good enough to make you want to play through the whole game.",

I was hoping I would like this hack 'n slash game as I have a tough time enjoying the genre, but this game just isn't for me.

        "content": "I put around 100+ hours into both P5 and P4G respectively, so I have some amount of experience with this franchise.  In short, this game is fun as hell.  Now for the long part.  The combat is fast paced and has interesting mechanics to boot.  You would think that pausing the game in order to select a skill from a menu would be detrimental to the pace of battle, but it actually isn't. Furthermore, every member of the Phantom Thieves has their own unique playstyle, which kind of implies that each PT member has their own situational usage.  Joker has his usual \"wild card\" sitch, Ryuji is the heavy, Morgana becomes a car, Ann has an enchant, Yusuke is a Fire emblem character, you can finally ride Makoto's bike, Haru is a beyblade, and the two new characters each have their own thing going on too.  Sophia is a great addition to the PT, acting as kind of a Morgana 2.0 from P5, (she navigates the PT to and through the Jails, which are like Palaces from P5, so no Sophia means no game) considering she's an amnesiac who has no clue what her origin is.  However, instead of being quite annoying like our favorite mascot, Sophia ends up being one of the most likable characters in the whole game.  Then there's Zenkichi, who's basically Dojima from P4 [spoiler] but he's a Persona user [/spoiler].  He is also an amazing addition to the PT, acting as a kind of \"team dad,\" who looks out for and genuinely cares about his team, his family, and justice.  The villains in this game are also pretty great.  Instead of being one-dimensional hate sinks like in P5 (not R), these guys have more depth to their actions, usually acting the way they are due to trauma and abuse from earlier points in their lives.  Main bad guy is kind of a toss up though, since I still think Shido had so much going on in P5 that it's really hard to even come close to him, and [spoiler] Konoe [/spoiler] felt less diabolical once you learn his backstory.  Overall, I think this game is great, but I did have some issues with fullscreen and had a few crashes.  Definitely worth the buy!",

However, I believe that the game's pacing was rushed to hit a deadline, leading to the game feeling pretty mediocre and stale after a while.\n\nThis game is supposedly a direct sequel to Persona 5, and the story itself does feel like it, but it completely disregards any of the events of Persona 5 Royal so whether its canon is entirely up in the air. \n\nThis game's rendering engine could also seriously use some AA as the art style looks totally whack. \n\nA decent game but not worth $60 (I paid $70) - 6/10",

        "content": "Little late adding this review as I beat the game/post game a while ago, but opted not to go into Merciless Mode. So just to say upfront: Strikers is fucking great. As someone that played a single Dynasty Warrior game like two decades ago, hated it, and never played another, this was an amazingly fun experience. That said, it's defiantly still a Persona game, which is good. Weakness and Technical attacks are the biggest key to actually getting anything done so it's not just mindlessly spamming the same combo every which way the wind blows. Technical hits in particular are vastly more important then in P5/Royal since you can Ailment bosses and especially trigger Technical hits that will chip away at enemy shields (which is necessary for the few enemies with no Weaknesses).\n\nI would only recommend people interested to hold off if they haven't played P5/Royal since it is a sequel. On that note, the events of Strikers seem to be based off the ending of P5 rather then the true ending of Royal. No mention of Yoshizawa.",

        "content": "I enjoyed the game, but it is not without flaws.\nTLDR: The game crashes, save frequently. Combat is fun but some fights can drag on too long. The plot is fine, nothing special but having the gang all together in new places has some great interactions. If you are a fan of the Phantom Thieves and can stomach the potential crashes and gameplay issues, get it. If you aren't invested in the characters, there isn't much reason to get this over other action games.\n\ncrashes - In the 60 hrs it took me to beat the game on normal and do all requests, the game crashed several times during loading screens. There are few things more frustrating than beating a tedious optional boss and then the game crashing when you leave the area.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, each story boss has a unique design and arena that makes their fight interesting. Mini-bosses not so much, they felt more like tedious resource drains. The optional bosses even more so, spamming skills to destroy their guard just to have your fully upgraded all-out-attack move the hp bar 10 pixels doesn't feel great.\n\nUnlike other musou games, melee kinda takes a back seat. The combination of melee doing small chip damage and 100 things flying around the battle, makes melee risky and unrewarding and persona skills far superior. Other than generic grunts, if you are approximately the same level as an enemy they don't especially care about any attacks that aren't the element they are weak against. Each character has a combo or 2 that deal their element as damage without using sp, but the real deal hits harder. You're gonna want to stock up on sp recovery for challenging fights.\n\nThere are some fun character interactions as the thieves interact with each other in new situations and environments. I also love the new characters. There is nothing from royal since the games were being made at the same time, so don't expect 3rd semester character growth to be present here.",

This game has all the complexity in mechanics and gameplay of the mainline series squished uncomfortably into a far more fast paced game.  You must still juggle multiple persona types and hit weaknesses while making sure to not deplete your SP, but now with the added annoyance of large scale battles where you must also weave and dodge attacks.  Too many times I've lost fights because my team didn't have the correct type matchups, or we burned through all our SP in a single strong enemy encounter.  These are fine in a 100+ hour turn-based RPG, but it feels VERY out of place in a Dynasty Warriors-style hack n slash.  \n\nI loved Persona 5 and there are times when I love Strikers, but it's far too complex to enjoy consistently for me.",

While not a perfect fix, I found changing the settings to not be fullscreen and the ratio to be 1.0 to help a lot.

P4 Golden was such a great port.

Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",

        "content": "This might just be a computer issue, but the game crashes almost every time I try and boot it up or when theres a transition(i.e cutscenes, going to different locations, etc.)and its caused me to get stuck fighting the same battle over and over again even though I have already beaten it. Good thing the battles are crazy fun, swapping from a turn based to open world combat system is one of the best changes to the persona formula imo. The personas are all unique as well despite joker being the only one to wield multiple. The new characters, villains, dialogue, features, and boss fights all make for a wonderful experience. Atlas has outdone themselves yet again, give the game a try if you have $60 to spare!",

You can use any controller you can connect to Steam for this game but you need to launch the game with the controller already in use on the PC. I recommend launching the game from \"Big Picture\" mode. \n\nOne major issue (at the time of this review 4/13/21) is a crashing issue. My game has crashed when entering Jails (this game's version of a Palace) and during transition sequences within the Jails. So i HIGHLY recommend saving at EVERY possible chance you get or you will lose progress when it crashes.\n\nMusic is great, just like in every other Persona game. \n\nGameplay is obviously different but once you get used to it you will enjoy it, especially if you like games like Dynasty Warriors. Being able to play as any character in your party is a nice touch and having (almost) every beloved Phantom Thief unlocked right away is a good touch. Joker's Wild Card still lets you get Personas, but now instead of convincing them to join you they will instead sometimes drop masks when defeated. Fusion is more or less the same with some new mechanics that are easy to understand.\n\nSophia is new best girl?",

Expect several crashes throughout your playthough and save often, as it feel mitigate a lot of the frustrations that come from a maiden voyage from a company dipping their toes in the PC market.",

Not that the turn-based is bad, just that this system is just a lot more fun.\n-Standard Persona stuff, honestly do not get this game if you've never played persona 5. \n\nCons\n-Even though the combat is fun, it's repetitive. After awhile, you can't even enjoy the music since you are way too powerful for the normal minions, Even on hard. Go in, all-out-attack and repeat. The mini-bosses are fun and should be integrated more and much more often. \n\n-In my 60 hour gameplay, I crashed 5 times. That's not really game breaking but a bit annoying. And it's random too. My pc specs is above average ( ryzen 7 3700x & RTX 3080 ). Your mileage might differ, but 5 times in 60 hrs is kinda annoying since there is no autosave. \n-Why release the sequel on multiple platforms and not the original? really weird decision making.\n\nConclusion\n-For persona 5 players : instant buy\n-normal people : play persona 5 first\n-for people who hate weeb stuff : hell no",

        "content": "A fantastic game, but not for the reasons I expected. Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5. The world needs more Persona games.",

Though only six months had passed for them since we attacked and dethroned god, I hadn\u2019t properly spent time with our ragtag group in three years (barring one weird dancing fever dream).

        "content": "While this game's combat mechanics are fun and fresh in their divergence from Persona's normal turn-based gameplay, the story (while it has its moments) is a boring retread of material from past Persona games, and apart from the fanservice for players of Persona 5 I can't recommend this game on the merits of its narrative. The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found. It's only crashed a few times for me. But ymmv i guess\n\nHaru also continues to be good.\n\n[b]tldr; good combat, boring recycled story, slightly unstable port. play if you really need that much more persona in your veins, probably buy on a sale, don't expect too much. 3/5 - decent.[/b]",

        "content": "Having finally finished Persona 5 after playing through it for six months, I decided to hop onto Persona 5 Strikers as soon as I finished. I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay. But releasing the semi-sequel to a game that's exclusive to one platform and having it being a multi-plat title before the original game gets ported to anything else is just kind of funny to me.",

        "content": "I find myself very in between on this game I love Persona 4 & 5, the story and game play are fantastic, I also love the fast pace of Koei-Tecmo's Samurai/Dynasty warrior games. With that being said this game should totally be up my ally right. Well long story short I enjoyed the story, the game play was just OK. A lot of the time It was hard to follow what is going on in fights and the difficulty spike on the first mini boss was jarring. I think again story wise the game is pretty good more time with the phantoms thieves and overall comes to a satisfying conclusion. The game play is the weak point for me, I also wish the hub cities were bigger/had more to do, with all that the game is worth getting for story alone and the overall environments the jails present are visually really cool, but again I had trouble with the fighting/abilities or really investing in any of the other characters abilities( played joker pretty much exclusively) *spoiler really sucks if you haven't done this by the end of the game*. recommend for story but game play is hard to get into that's just my opinion. Story also felt a little long by the end of it and this is from someone who has played Yakuza: like a dragon, Persona 4 & Persona 5.",

Significant character growth was literally non-existent.\n- Copious frame rate drops during jails; could just be my specs but HOT DAMN did they bust my ass.\n\nVerdict: If you're looking for fluid gameplay or just love Persona, you're in for a treat. Storywise, ehh......hold it off until it's on sale.\n- 7/10",

It\u00b4s more time with the phantom thieves and their members, which is great. Sure, you dont have to manage school-life or your confidances, and battles are fought in real time, but it still FEELS all Persona 5-ey. If you played the original (or Royal) you know what I mean, the style, the music and the whole atmosphere.\nIt\u00b4s just a bit different, but I would like to stress that that\u00b4s not a bad thing. You just feel a different kind of rush and excitement when you have to control the movements of the thieves directly in battle, The change in genre fits surprisingly well (at least for me)! Before you had all these thievy characters in a rather static battle-system, this one allows you to experience much better how the phantom thieves sneak around enemies or weave through them, and it feels awesome.\n\nSo yeah, watch Queen screaming FIST OF JUSTICE while the new Last Surprise track is blasting and try to tell me you dont love this. \n\n10/10, more \"For reals\"s from Ryuji\n11/10 Ryuji drops the f-bomb finally",

The writing for the characters has lowered in quality from the first. Everyone's words just feel hollow. My main source of fun in P5S was in persona fusions and actual fighting.

        "content": "After completing everything this game has (Merciless Mastered), it's a really great and even if you're trying persona 5 for the first time, you could hop in and have a great time with the characters. Though of course, HIGHLY recommend that you play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before entering here as you'll get to be more attached to the characters beforehand.\n\nI've never really played any kind of game like this in the past so I started on normal and that was already a good enough challenge personally. So don't worry about starting on normal if you're not looking for a challenge, that's why there's a merciless mode for those who want to challenge themselves. I think starting on hard mode is also a good enough challenge for those starting out. \nI think the gameplay is near perfect for those who want to either take it back and just play casually and those who really want to challenge themselves. The mechanics are simple but if you want to be able to maximise your output you have to be strategic with quite a lot of things. Combo's with normal attacks, combo's into your persona, and evading your enemy, while you can button mash, you'll get punished for not knowing what you do in hard boss fights and especially on merciless mode. Merciless will destroy you if you aren't being conscious of what you're doing in terms of attacks and spacial awareness, if you get caught by an enemy you'll most likely be dead, your entire party included.\nStarting on normal and then switching to hard later on I feel is the best thing to do. Normal will teach you the main mechanics well while hard will challenge you on using those mechanics to the best of your abilities. Merciless will challenge everything you have mechanics and resource wise. \n\nWhile the story isn't too heavy handed in terms of twists and complexity, it's a very enjoyable one with barely any bad moments. The dynamics between the characters are honestly written very well and they really do feel like a band of merry friends at the end of the day. And the new characters are amazing too, they're a very nice addition to the group.\nMusic is top notch, seriously, I don't have a single song I hate in this game. From city vibing, to the many and various battle themes, there's so much to enjoy.\nAnd I do love me some boss fights. I really do like all of them. While some have some annoying mechanics, they aren't frustrating to deal with.\n\nIf you've seen other reviews, then you've seen that this game has a complaint of crashing. And yes it does, I had quite a few in the beginning but I kind of learned a trick that could help others if you're having the issue as well.\nDuring transition screens whether that's areas, the metaverse, or after boss battles, that's where the game usually crashes (at least for me). Don't furiously click or press any keys during these transitions. Rapid clicks or pressing of the keyboard have caused like, 99% of my crashes so while it may be different for others, those with the issues may find that this will help and hopefully it does.\n\nBut yeah, it's an amazing game. I hope this review helps in some type of way as I felt it was necessary after getting all the achievements possible in this game.",

        "content": "Quick heads up before you play this game,\nThis game is a direct sequel to Persona 5 and you will be lost playing this without understanding the story of Persona 5. Although the developments from Persona 5 Royal are kinda disregarded here, I'd recommend playing that instead of base P5, if not for the improvements on the base game then purely for the Third Semester.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a hefty addition spanning (in my case) 50 hours long. A third of P5R and half of P5. The combat here heavily resembles that of dynasty warriors, in which you have to fight off hordes of opponents in real time with 3 more phantom thieves by your side. The story here is kind of weak compared to P5R, but still really enjoyable and fulfilling besides. If you have played P5 or P5R, I'd highly recommend this game as despite the main 8 thieves not getting much character development (as they already got all of it from their confidants in P5), it is still nice seeing them ebb and flow off each other and the two new main characters.\n\nTime to go on a trip with P5S and steal back some desires.",

The jails don't feel like Warriors battlefields, they feel like dungeons. Not saying that's inherently bad, just wasn't what I was expecting. The writing isn't amazing, in fact they somehow managed to make the characters feel even more one note than they did in the first game. But persona spin offs are always like that, let's be real all of us were going into this expecting that. If I could give this a neutral rating I would.

The gameplay is smooth and tight, the combat is fun.\n\nThe open combat style actually fits surprisingly well with the Persona roster of abilities and demons.

More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.",

        "content": "Having played and 100% Persona 5 originally, I was quite excited to get back into the world of Persona 5. The OST, group, and overall atmosphere was something I really enjoyed. With Persona 5 Strikers coming, I was looking forward to catching up with the Phantom Thieves. Seeing the characters and the world yet again felt a burst of memories from the original title. This game mixes up its gameplay with introducing a more Dynasty Warriors feel (well, it's made by the developers). So the game is HEAVY on the mobs of enemies you face with each character having their own personal combos/moves to perform in combat. The \"Palace\" aspect for the dungeons has been changed (won't say for spoiler sake), but it's more or less the same format. \n\nComing up on my personal opinion of the game being halfway through, it's kinda... meh? It's not a bad thing in no way, but the game does tend to just be rinse and repeat constantly. Gameplay is good enough to continue playing, but the story just kinda wanes as it goes by. If you're someone who wanted to wait for a sale, I say do so. You're not gaining or losing anything from playing/not playing the game. It's just more Persona 5. If that's what you've been yearning for, you won't be disappointed in that regard. The OST is great as usual for a Persona game. My overall first impressions of everything are fairly solid. Regardless, if you played the original Persona 5/Royal and have missed the Phantom Thieves, then this is definitely that game to scratch that itch.",

        "content": "If you've played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal and enjoyed them, I highly (HIGHLY) recommend this game. However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.",

        "content": "At first I was a bit skeptical on how this game might play especailly being a fan of the other persona games, but hearing a lot of good reviews about it, and seeing some gameplay I decided to try out myself. So far I am really enjoying myself. I love how it does feel like a sequal to persona 5( Although I wish is was a sequal to Royal.) I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes. I've only finished the first dungeon right now, but haven't encountered any issues at the moment which is nice since so many new games nowadays has some type of issues.",

The game ends on credits with no other modes/co-op so there is little incentive to keep playing past hitting credits other than going for 100% (not even new game +).

        "content": "Don't buy this game if you haven't played through the original Persona 5 (vanilla, not Royal) which sadly isn't available on PC (legally at least...). If you did this game is much more than just a musou and I definitely recommend it.\n\nWhile it doesn't have social links and the calendar system this game is pretty much a sequel to Persona 5.\n\nAlmost all the elements from the original turn-based combat system are also present in the new real time combat of Strikers even if they work a bit differently. Affinities, skills, Persona fusion (obviously not to the same extent), the dungeon crawling; it's all there and it's fun!\n\nThe story doesn't only take place in Shibuya this time, it's a roadtrip across Japan and the changing scenery/locations constantly keep things interesting. The new characters are great, the music is fantastic as always. All the characters play differently with their own unique mechanics and due to the affinity system you need to pick the right party and persona loadout for Joker for the right bosses/encounters.\n\nThe story is decent, it starts out very solid but unfortunately runs out of steam close to the end. The pacing is all over the place. The last boss is [spoiler]pretty much the same as the one from vanilla Persona 5 (literally the same being if you know a bit about gnosticism...)[/spoiler], so I wasn't really paying much attention at the end anymore, it just felt like a repeat and the phantom thieves were saying very similar lines that didn't have much of an impact anymore.\n\nThe combat can get very tedious especially in the late game. Even on Normal difficulty some bosses and shadows will have very high HP pools while your party members can die in 2-3 hits. You spend alot of time just whittling away at their life until you manage to knock them down for an all out attack which maybe does like 10% of their HP. I understand they wanted the combat to be more strategic and focused on exploiting enemy weaknesses but at some point it just stops being fun. Especially when the party member AI occasionally has a brain fart and just lets bosses one shot them with highly telegraphed attacks.\n\nDespite all this I still had a very good time with Strikers and I think anyone who liked Persona 5 also will.",

I am pretty sure I saved in front of the last dungeon and I don't care much to start the game again to find out the biggest reveal of the story.\n\nThe game is very linear, you still don't get to choose what to do on days any more like the old personas. I used to really enjoy when the game was less linear and experiencing different sides of people would cause their arcana type to level up, or you could browse the shopping network on Sunday and get items. Choices are missing from this game and you are pulled along rails listening to a story that doesn't quite make you feel emotional to outweigh the dungeon crawler theme.",

The combat does require you to abuse the weaknesses of enemies as done in the original Persona franchise therefore at time MP usages can be draining during  a single run in the dungeons - so do keep in mind to find checkpoints and pop in and out of the dungeons to refresh the MCs MP and HP as well as switch party members. If your going to pick this up straight up spend as much time as you want in the cities you visit in the real world (in game) as there are things you might miss. Overall a great game with an always amazing sound track by Lyn, Lotus and the Atlus/ Toei did an amazing job!",

The story is pretty good too and the OST is great as always with Persona games. I can highly recommend this game if you are a fan of Persona 5 or Musou games or want the best of both worlds.",

        "content": "The gameplay is pretty simple and easy to understand. HOWEVER, some significant flaws like aiming guns are broken as your crosshair moves up and down like an earthquake simply from moving it in either left or right directions.\n\nThe store is also watered down a tad as you used to be able to sell all your junk with a push of a button in persona 5. with strikers, you must sell each item individually as the \"sell all junk\" button does not exist anymore.\n\nEverything else gameplay-wise was fine from what I have seen except for some exploits due to how far you can jump to places, and in certain areas, if you look up, you can pass entier areas without going to the actual entrance, which I accidentally did and backtracked to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe story is..... how to put it..... probably the worst thing about this game. The removal of all the supporting members from the game and being left with just a few new ones hurt the story badly. The hub world feels empty because of this, as there is nothing to do or get more investment in the story (at least from what I saw from beating the first palace). \nThe story also feels completely unrelated to me, as the stakes for beating any of the palaces are super low. While in the first game, the cops in the story would have arrested you the moment you were suspicious, even at the last scene of the game. In this one, it feels like no one cares (except for one guy) despite you being a phantom thief. You actually had severe consequences in the story in the first one, but in this game, it's just a straight path with some little stumbles and no risk. Maybe it gets better after the first palace, but I didn't care to continue as it felt pointless. i could compare this to mementos side stories, but with extra flair. that's basically it.\n\nI'm sure some people love this stuff, and gameplay-wise, it's obviously not bad. But for me, this was just boring to continue, which is ironic considering this game has more action in it than persona 5.",

In fact, I think the overall story was much better than the original P5 game. Don't get me wrong, I still love both stories but I think the Monarchs make so much better antagonists than the Palace Rulers. I love how this game took the idea of the Phantom Thieves and brought the question of how humanity acts and relies on free will and isolation. I felt like all of the Monarchs were in the position that they are purely because of how they fell off their paths in life instead of just being pure evil. This led to the change of hearts being much more believable and made me wonder how the Monarchs got to be the leaders of the jail every time I got to a new one and how we were going to save them. Overall, this game improves the concept of the Phantom Thieves and brings a brand new game play style that works together so well. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves good stories, good game play, or are just a fan of the Persona series in general.",

        "content": "I haven't played merciless/new game + yet but as of my base game experience so much fun, the gameplay is filled with flashy satisfying combos but many fights still require strategy and attention so it's such a perfect balance that it's addicting.  The writing is incredible as always and the characterization and interactions are arguably better than og persona 5 and royal.  The setting of the game as a summer roadtrip around Japan is genius and was a great breath of fresh air besides the familiar area of Shibuya.  The two main new characers Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions especially Zenkichi.  The visuals are also very pretty and refined especially the in-game cut scenes which honestly looked better than the anime cut scenes.  Overall I wanted more persona 5 and that's what this game gives you, exactly what I needed around this time.  The only complaints I have are the persona system with joker could be done a little better compared to previous p5 games, Lavenza and the velvet room in general should've been used in the plot a bit more or just change things up and make it more unique rather than \"Oh guess what you're a trickster of fate again\", and the plot near the end is pretty predictable and similar to P5R.  I can see why people don't like Sophia as well being the whole AI learns about the concepts of humanity thing but Sophia's interactions and expressions were very cute so it made up for it.  Every character gameplay wise is incredibly fun the best in my opinion being Makoto, Ryuji, and wolf(won't say who wolf is cuz spoilers) but the only complaint I have gameplay wise is Sophia, in a muso game I want to do big flashy moves or badass combos, with so much happening on the screen why would I want to practice timing perfect catches with a yoyo for sophia's combos how can I read her catches while watching every other enemy and dodging attacks, functionally her bless magic and healing are very helpful but that's all I really used her for her magic for bosses and mini bosses who were weak to bless or just healing team members she's the only character I found my self barely using in combat.\nOverall 9/10 very surprised and excited to do New Game +",

It's a mini persona 5 without a strict the strict calendar system, fast paced warriors combat and retains the Persona 5 dungeon crawling and mild stealth gameplay. The new characters are very likeable and all in all is a satisfying send off to the original Persona 5 continuity",

        "content": "Should you buy it? If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention some of the personas need to be fuse with a the early personas at certain level for example, King Frost - Lvl 40 Jack Frost + Lvl 40 Jack O' Lantern. Jack frost should be around level 20 when you get him, and Jack O Lantern is Level 8, So if you didnt level them up or dont have enough Persona points, it is gonna take some time to get some of the personas.",

Not gonna work.\" \n\nThe more I looked into it, the more it started to grow on me. Ended up pre-ordering sometime in January. Got it 3 days early because of the Deluxe order. Wow.\n\nI am so glad I picked this up. I fell in love with the Persona series when I got to try out Persona 4. Dark, Gritty, comical and pretty real when it came to terms and understanding characters. Played the original and P4 Golden. Absolutely loved every aspect of the game. Saw it released on steam and bought it without even thinking. :)\n\nThen P5 was announced!\nPre-orderd the box set before the prices when to crap before release. Completely loved the game and finished it.\nPersona 5 Royal. . . . CRAP! got to get it! Started to replay the game with the extras and to experience the new section of the story. Got about 76 hours into the game and lost everything past the 16 hour mark after a brown out. Forgot to upload to PS plus. Also, long story short. PS4 Pro, No Internal harddrive. Modified external with 8tb Barracuda Pro. Every brownout/ loss of power wiped the drive. After that happened, 2 tb SSD with the 8tb in a usb3 case. Works fine now but added a 1000 UPS unit to it. Honestly haven't touched it since\n\nStrikers though, I was positively blown away by how well this worked. A Dynasty Warriors take on Persona is certainly refreshing way to spin off an already great game. All of the characters we know and love are spot on and the VA's reprized their rolls wonderfully{save for Joker}. Absolutely love Zenkichi and Sophia and the parts they play. The gameplay was fluid and fast paced when needed and the music from the original games and the reprized Musou variants plus their original takes work perfectly for the new style of gameplay. Even the subtle change in the music when you went into the sneak sections was a pleasing change. I wonder how many people caught onto that change when they played those parts.\n\nThe story played out very well and was a pretty good length. I was surprised that it totaled almost 33 hours without doing the extra mission. It is pretty engrossing if you ask me with all of the comical, stereotypical, and serious character building while keep the balance of surreal, light, and dark positions each and every character goes through and faces during each mission or challenge.\n\nAll in all. The Highlights about the games really to make this a great play Save for the few things that I have found that started to break the immersion of the game. First off, The VA's did a wonderful job playing their parts but I found that the sound balancing in the game started to break the game. I was finding out that alot of the music did not lower when the characters spoke and alot of time the Va's voice would start to blend or even be overpowered by the music. I heard this alot when Skull spoke his dialogue. He even had a few lines that were inaudible or something that was completely non-exhistant when he talked. The constant crashing when the game was first released, which thankfully, was fixed with the beta update they released a week or so later. But when I really started to see was the slowdown during gameplay or in full on battles. I was well above the Recommended when I was running it first on my I5 6500, OLOy DDR4 2666{Limited to 2400 because of processor}, and my 1060 GXT SSC card. I kept getting slowdowns when I had alot of effects going on in game with more than 6 enemies on screen. It was the worse when I made it to the underground \"sewer\" part of the first Prison. The section near the end of the \"sewer\" part where the water was on the floor at the end of the dungen.  Upgraded the Processor and motherboard while keeping my memory and Vid card. Ryzen 5 3600X. was the processor upgrade and the game played almost flawlessly. Even got better framerates that stayed constant 60FPS even in the final dungeon where there were up to 50+ enemies on the field. I also found it strange that there were side quest mini bosses that were incredibly hard when compared to the normal Bosses and End game boss. I died more on those side quest bosses then I did on the Main ones. Once you started to get up in levels, the enemies became to easy which made it hard to start to complete the Character quests and Move sets. Maybe I will mess with it soon in a harder difficulty mode to see if my current Mode playthrough was the reason.\n\nNow, my last quip was Joker. I guess they could not get the original VA? I mean, His voice was alot more gruff at certain points but they used alot of his Persona 5 voice clips. It was very off putting listening to him. Other than that. It was a great game and was very enjoyable to play. Now I'll just wait for any expansions or new unlockable to see in game. Heres Hoping. ;)\n\n",

        "content": "Aight This Review contains spoilers for Persona 5: Strikers and Persona 5: Royal so don't complain when i reveal Yusuke was the main villain the whole time\n\nOkay anyway I enjoyed this game but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for 60 big ones unless you are an avid Persona Stan or you really enjoy this kind of Game. First off is the fact that the game likes crashing a lot and it also has a few glitches which might force you to close, which really sucks when you spend 30 minutes on the final boss fight and it crashes the next cutscene and I have to fight the boss all over again.\n\nNext is the story in General: If you played Persona 5, then you know the story of Persona 5: Strikers. There are bad guys in these palace like jails and it's up to the Phantom Thieves to change their hearts and take back their desires. Of course there is actually a false god who has been secretly pulling the strings and manipulating everything. It feels like you are playing a watered down fanfiction rather than an actual sequel with how similar it is to the main story. The only unique part of the story being Sophia but even then her plot is barely touched until the very end.\n\nNext are the characters: The main cast is back but it doesn't feel like they are back. They all act like parodies of themselves, like someone saw one scene in Persona 5 and based their entire personality off it. While its charming at first listening to the cast talk and crack jokes, there is only so many times we can hear about Ryuji's food obsession or Makoto's fist of justice or Yusuke being poor. The villains are all forgettable, their backstory is paper thin and the game tries to make it seem like they are morally grey characters or arent truly evil, but they dont even keep this pattern up half the time. Some villains are complete assholes who murder their parents, while others are boring and barely even criminals, like the guy who wrote a bad book. It felt like there was an attempt to make a villain who is good, but uses the wrong method like Takuto Maruki from Royal, but they all fall short. Maruki worked so well because he was a good guy and actually was attempting to do good, even if his methods and ways were wrong. The villains that try to seem redeemable are all murders whose control other people to force them to do their bidding. Even the twist villain who everyone could see coming just felt dry, like they needed someone to explain why EMMA even became a god in the first place.\n\nGameplay: The game play seems fun at first, but it quickly gets old after a while, it is just beat up the enemy, move forward, wow another ambush, beat up the enemy, fight a 10 minute mini boss, fight a 30 minute boss. There is just too much combat that feels unrewarding and dry, The time outside of the metaverse feels empty, like a poor imitation of the main games open world. The time progression system is completely uselss, and there is little to do outside except shop for groceries so you can have more sp and complete side request which just waste more time. Every area felt the same with no uniqueness, every battle felt the same, learn the enemies weaknesses and spam the move that works. Unlike the main game, which had a lot of flair, each battle lacks anything close to the art style and flair of the main game as you see all the game has to offer in about and hour of game play. God bless anyone who didnt buy the Legacy music because I could not stand listening to the same three combat songs over and over again. \n\nOverall this game is not worth $60, maybe $40 but i wouldn't go any higher, just wait for a sale if you really want it, also atlus pls fix your game I want to go one cutscene without crashing pls",

        "content": "This game is practically Persona 5 Lite. Contains a lot from base Persona 5, except social links and a restricted free roam. Time does not pass in this game when you do any sort of action, but instead only passes through story. It does feel rather cheaply made at first, though, since you can't run while free roaming, and all but two non party confidants were completely removed from the game because of [strike] low budget [/strike] convenient reasons. However, it shouldn't take much time to adjust to this.\n\nThe only gripe I can give this game is the combat. It works, but it's not great. Be warned, you will be dropped from full HP to 0 in less than a second many times in this game, and that's the game's biggest issue. I don't think they realized just how strong enemy moves were, so when you have 7 of them doing the same move all at once, it packs one hell of a punch. The majority of persona moves are also rather useless. Really, I never once used a physical skill, and I only used a magic skill a hand full of times. The only worth while skills in this game are stat buffs/debuffs, heals, and passives. Everything else, including skills like concentrate and charge, are completely worthless. Also, anything that was meant to hit all targets in the base game is also completely useless. It just costs more SP with a wider area of affect. Normal trash enemies don't need any debuffs to fight. The only thing you should use debuffs on is for anything that has a health bar on the top of the screen, and since it's only one enemy, you can save double the SP for just using the smaller area of effect debuffs.\n\nOverall, it's Persona 5 through and through with the only major change being Action RPG combat. If you liked P5's story and characters, you'll like this, and appreciate it too.",

I would NOT recommend it if you haven't played Persona 5 for two reasons: 1. The game is a sequel to P5 so you wont really get most of the references or relationships. And 2. PERSONA 5 IS AMAZING AND SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT PLAYING IT. All jokes aside, this game is really fun, once you get into the flow of combat, it is really enjoyable. It has all of the charm of P5 and P5R, I was itching for more Persona 5 after finishing Royal and this is a very nice change of pace while still tying beautifully into the original story.",

The story was awesome, really fun, though still pretty similar to the typical persona formula, so slightly predictable at times, but still well done and touching. It actually made me cry a couple times on some themes that really hit home for me. The music is dope, as always, and I liked the variety, cause hearing the same one over and over can get old fast. And I think hard mode is well balanced.\nSide Note: this is a sequel, so if you haven't played original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then I highly recommend playing one of those first, or watching someone's playthrough if you don't mind spoilers. Hopefully they'll make that available on PC soon for anyone without a PS4/5",

        "content": "TL;DR The only criteria you need to think about if you're considering playing is \"Did you like Persona 5?\" If the answer is yes, play this without question. I would NOT recommend this at all if you haven't played the original Persona 5, this builds up directly on top of Persona 5 and you'll feel lost if this is your first Persona game.\n\nI'd give this a 8.5/10, only because Persona 4 and 5 have set a very high standard, so obviously this cannot compete with that but you'll never feel like this was a low-effort cash grab. It's very much a good polished game worth your time and you shouldn't compare it to Persona 5 which had a wayyy longer development time and budget.\n\nWhile there are definitely some weak links, you'll never feel bad about it when you're playing, and I had as much a blast with this game as much as I did with the other main Persona titles. In fact, I actually prefer this action combat system over Persona's original turn-based combat. Any future Persona games using this sort of combat over turn-based combat would be a dream come true (sadly it won't happen but it's fun to think about)\n\nAgain, this is totally worth your money if you've played and liked the original Persona 5. I'm just sad it has ended and I'll have to wait a long time for another high-quality Persona game. I have very specific reasons for not giving it a perfect score but it's not for this review. I feel like there were some game design/level design issues and Sophia is an unlikable character for me personally. But then again, Persona games have always been cheesy, and all those issues won't really bother you when you're playing; they only seem worse in hindsight when you think about them afterwards.\n\nThank you Omega Force, P-Studio and Atlus for making this. I greatly enjoyed my time and now I feel like I'm in a void again now that this has ended.",

But I feel that they captured the feel of one nicely. The UI and menus look exactly like Persona 5 did, and the story and gameplay change work in this context. Most of the battles are fun but none get so challenging that you need to grind for hours on end. \n\nOne thing to note, I can't seem to launch or play this game full screen. I don't think it was made to be played on a keyboard so I'd recommend a controller. Since thats how I play I have to launch in bigpicture mode...which wants to launch the game in fullscreen. Sometimes just launching the game is...a struggle. so I mostly leave it open all day to save myself the headache.  I'd say go out and buy it...just not on steam.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers (or scramble if you're playing the JP version) is a fairly good ActionJRPG. HOWEVER, it has a very big problem of crashing, sometimes at the worst possible time (I have literally had crashes immediately after finishing a boss fight losing upwards of an hour of progress). I do still recommend the game to anyone wanting to dip their feet into the SMT/Persona series, though it does not only contain spoilers for the base Persona 5 game (takes place not too long after the end of Persona 5) and it also expects you to know the general gist of the plot of Persona 5 as well. Until a patch does come out addressing the stability issues though, I must say to save very frequently to avoid loss of progress. Game length wise is about 40 hours doing most of the side missions/Requests on Normal difficulty so you do get your money's worth, and New Game+ does exist if you feel like rerunning at higher difficulties.",

They did this game a huge amount of Justice, I honestly felt like crying when I beat the game, mainly because of the fact that the Visuals are extremely beautiful and you can relate to the Characters in most situations, and mostly because I didn't want it to End.

Much better than most other Musou games, as it certainly feels like Atlus/Sega really had their hands in this to feel like a Musou game, but kept the theme and fighting to still feel like a Persona game. All the Thieves had their own showtimes, combat arts, and everyone just felt different in all the right ways. \n\nLastly, the music BUMPS. Persona games have always nailed this, but GOTDAMN this game got the tunes perfect! Every city and the tunes that follow it work for the areas. Everything like coming into the jails, the song playing for the big moments like \"Daredevil\", the title song \"You are Stronger\" Much better than P5 originally, as some palaces didn't really have themes that fit them well. \n\nMy biggest complaint as of now, is the crashing. The game crashes a good amount during some loading screens. Wasn't enough to deter me from playing, since I save almost every time I go to the hideout, before I have to load to the next area, but I was very nervous during some cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, super fun game. I loved every minute of it, and it didn't super overstay its welcome like P5 did. P5R helped manage the time better, and this game, every moment felt impactful and kept me on my toes.\n\n10/10. Gonna miss the Phantom Thieves a bunch.",

Go play P5 if you want to do that, then come back here. Or go play P4 on Steam if you don't have a Playstation. There are a lot of injokes and character specific stuff that'll woosh right past you if you haven't played P5 beforehand, and while the gameplay is pretty good, that's almost certainly not why most people want to play this. But if you have played P5, you know why you want to play this, and it will not disappoint.\n\nI'm surprised how well the Persona 5 style was integrated into the hack and slash genre. It really does feel like a Persona game first and a musou game second. Not to mention that it's on Steam and the port is even pretty good! The only other thing I really could ask for is this fitting with Royal better, since this really is a follow-up from P5 and not P5R, but given how Atlus chose to develop both of these games, that wasn't really doable. Real shame. But I'm not gonna complain, since things turned out pretty good.",

It is pretty much like the actual persona games where you go through the metaverse and battle dudes after another(like pokemon/dragon quest/persona LOL) even though it's not a turn based game. It feels more of an RPG game than a warriors game. There are times I feel like I am actually playing persona 5. I mean you still battle hordes of enemies but this game does the formula the best and I hope future warriors games follow this \"pattern\"",

        "content": "I just now 100% the game and I can safely say this. Persona 5 Strikers for me was a great game all the way through. When I first approached this game, I immediately assumed it was going to be the same musou experience like the Warriors games I've played in the past. The first 5 hours I was a little disappointed when its core game play and mechanics weren't exactly what I expected. But then I remembered that this is a sequel to the first game and treated as such while still in the mindset of musou player. After that, it changed my view for this entirely. Its music and plot made it even more enjoyable and the fact that each playable member is unique in its own right even it was straight to the point. This is definitely a must have for Persona fans and perhaps newcomers. I will give this a 8/10. If you're still iffy about getting it or not then wait for it when goes sale. Also don't get the ALL-OUT ATTACK PACK, it is not worth the money and you can easily get its in-game skills and items progressively. Aight yall be good people and WEAR YO MASK!",

        "content": "I recommend this game but it is more of a cautionary one.\n\n*Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5. It is not exactly a sequel to Persona 5 Royal \u2013 the expanded version released later. So Royal exclusive characters are not present in this game nor are the events of its third semester are covered. Persona 5 Strikers\u2019 release on Steam is admittedly rather strange considering that neither the original Persona 5 or the Royal version are not present on the platform, so new PC players are likely to be confused and would spoil the events of the original game.\n\nI have seen some players say that you do not need to play the original game but that is not true at all. It is highly recommended that you should play, at least, the original Persona 5 before Persona 5 Strikers either on PS4 or by waiting for a Steam release if that happens.*\n\nI really enjoyed the story of this sequel. Most Persona spin offs have rather tepid stories but this one pulls its weight above the others. The road trip setup is a great idea and it all helps solidify the fact that the Phantom Thieves are a close set of friends overall. It\u2019s also quite funny and entertaining overall. I also enjoyed the new characters \u2013 Zenkichi and Sophia \u2013 and thought they fitted in well with the story and the Phantom Thieves\u2019 road trip as well. But sightseeing is unfortunately limited and you feel like you\u2019re in the Metaverse more than the locations you visit. Additionally, whilst the bond system is competent and makes sense in the context of the story it cannot replace the freedom of the confidant system from the original game (returning players may be disappointed with the lack of returning side characters from P5 as well, although it would be a stretch to involve them in this story). The result is a far more linear, repetitive, and straightforward journey. (On a side note I found that some plot elements from previous games were repeating in P5 Strikers, not just jokes but also character backstories as well \u2013 quite distracting for those familiar with the main games and I hope that fresh plot details are explored for the next inevitable numbered sequel.)\n\nP5 Strikers\u2019 gameplay is designed to be like an arcade like experience. Within the Metaverse combat has been changed from turn based battles into Dynasty Warriors real time combat where you face many enemies at once. The change from turn based to real time combat works surprisingly well and fits naturally for a spin-off title. It can get repetitive and grindy but for the most part it was fun. Persona fusion also returns but it is scaled down in comparison to the original and does not have the depth previous seen in prior games. But it\u2019s all in service for this arcade gameplay and as I said previously it works well and it is fun to play. \n\nThe game also successfully adapts Persona 5's graphical style and music. The new music in this game is really good and effortlessly reaches the same standards of the original game and the Royal version.\n\nI never really had a major issue with any of the game\u2019s mechanics, story, or characters. But the most severe issues are the technical problems and the state of the port. Reviewers and posts on the Steam discussion page report have constantly reported the infinite loading screen and crashing bugs. I have experienced it as well. I was prevented from playing the game for about a week since it refused to load the main menu in full screen or borderless mode. Only opening the game in windowed mode worked but I got frame drops and it was not smooth. I only managed to get around these loading screen crashes when I saw a post on the Steam Discussion that recommended disabling the additional content that contained the behind the scenes and interviews for the game. Apparently there was an issue in the content that carried over into the main game that caused the severe crashing. After disabling it I managed to load the game and play it in a more stable state. Whoever that person was who recommended disabling that \u2013 may Philemon bless you because you saved my play through.\n\nHowever, that was not the end of my issues playing the game. Whilst I never experienced the boss crashes that prevent you from advancing I still experienced crashes when transitioning to a new area or whilst in a loading screen although it never repeats this behaviour constantly. I also experienced stuttering during the in-game and anime cut scenes but perhaps the most annoying bug I had experienced was the severe frame drops and the resolution glitch. Sometimes I would have severe unexplained frame drops despite being at the game\u2019s highest settings at 1080p for the majority of my play through. When I changed the settings and reset them the game looked more pixilated and blurry despite, again, being at high settings. It was a frustrating issue and I only managed to solve it by playing around with the render quality function which makes me think there is a bug associated with the option.\n\nI also experienced some inconsistent issues regarding the English voice acting as well. The English voice acting is rather good so there is no issue regarding the actors themselves. It\u2019s just some characters sound quiet against the background music and I had to change the sound settings just so that I can hear them. I had this problem more so with Yusuke and Zenkichi. This is an impact of the pandemic since these actors most likely worked at home where they probably did not have the best sound mixing equipment.\n\n(I should mention that some people may not have encountered any issues at all and that this experience is not universal for everyone.)\n\nThis port is a mess and desperately needs to be patched. But we are a month after release and Atlus have not released one \u2013 only a Beta Branch. After the initial issues regarding the PC ports of Catherine and Persona 4 Golden they cannot keep releasing games like this on Steam on day 1 and remain silent on official fixes until they happen, whether its future games or ports of older games. It\u2019s quite frustrating. It does not help that people begging for more Persona on Steam drown out the concerns made about the bugs and issues with the port.\n\nWhat we are left with is a game that is really fun to play with a stellar story and great additional characters that are welcome in the world of Persona 5. It is likely the best spin-off yet for the franchise. But at the same time my playthrough on PC was unstable and prone to technical problems. This is why I give Persona 5 Strikers a cautionary recommendation because the fun I had playing the game managed to outshine the quality of the port and I managed to look past it. Whilst I managed to play through the game, for those who want the game but haven\u2019t purchased it on Steam yet I would wait until it is patched and the main issues are resolved. I know it is bad to wait on a game to be patched when we all waited for over a year for this game to be localised into English, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n(This review may be changed or removed if a patch is released.)",

        "content": "I haven't met many people in recent years who hadn't heard of Persona 5 in some fashion. Whether it was someone who had played every persona game before, just P5, or had heard of it through an annoying Twitter fan or some other medium, it is clear P5 has made some kind of impact in the gaming world. I am someone who has played every game since the original, and I am not one to shy away from the fact that I'm someone who has enjoyed every one of the games I've played.\n\nWhen I finished P5, I remember being content with the game over all. There were characters I wished they had flushed out a bit more, story lines I felt were unnecessary, and some general annoyances; but overall, I enjoyed it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a direct sequel in the form of Strikers, I was actually pretty excited. I had expected them to do a \"Crimson\" version (which they ended up doing with Royal), similar to Persona 4 Golden or Persona 3 FES, so getting a fully new game centered as a direct sequel sounded like an awesome change of pace. When it initially came out only in Japan, with no plans for a western release, I was bummed, but I figured it would come to the states eventually. So I played Royal and waited, keeping myself away from spoilers.\n\nWhen I got the game in my hands, I knew nothing about it aside from the fact that it was not a traditional RPG style Persona game we've come to expect. It was a style more akin to the Dynasty Warriors games, and while I had dabbled a bit on the surface with Hyrule Warriors before, I wasn't sure what I would be getting into.\n\nI am now very close to having all the achievements and beating the game on merciless, so I can say I have delved into the game pretty deeply.\n\nThis game is amazing. \n\nIt is an amazing blend of RPG mechanics from Persona that makes for exciting battle flows and creative persona setups, and the Dynasty Warrior hack-and-slash game play. Unlike Hyrule Warriors, you don't fight onslaughts of baby AI enemies that can barely touch you. You fight mini battles, similarly to turn based games, getting an opportunity to strike while they're unaware, or falling victim to their attack on you. You are encouraged to constantly switch party members to get combo chains off with the baton pass and 1-More system that made Persona 5 so satisfying to battle with. It remains simple to learn Dynasty Warriors, hard to master Persona style the whole way. It's a refreshing take on battles that I enjoy so much, and hope to see more of if they continue to enjoy this partnership together.\n\nThe story is a continuation from the original, the gang is all back together, with some new people to boot, and while it feels slow at times, similarly to the original, the game makes up for that by placing you in charming settings and well crafted dungeons to explore. Each dungeon theme is unique, and the atmospheres they set are great, borderline some of the best the series offers. I enjoyed everyone in the game again, and it seemed as if the voice actors did as well - they really shine in this installment.\n\nMany game mechanics are streamlined compared to P5. There are no social links, you instead get BOND points you get through leveling up a BOND meter (doing anything from battling, to completing cutscenes/requests, and even little mini events in each town). You have one store you buy and sell everything through. Joker can make food that gives benefits to his party members in battle. Persona's retain their forgotten moves, and you can switch moves around any time outside of combat (a HUGE improvement over the original). Fusing personas has been drastically simplified, which does make it easier in some ways, harder in others. Your control over your persona's levels and stats are streamlined very effectively, making keeping useful persona's around for longer much more easy than the original.\n\nThe music in this game is very different from P5 in most ways. There are times when an original track plays, building off of that continuation piece of the game, but there are plenty of new tracks to listen and jam to. The new towns you'll travel to all have great tunes, and the dungeon themes are incredibly unique from the very first one to the last. You can tell there was an attempt to try to be a bit more flashy with the soundtrack in most cases, which makes sense as this is a flashy beat-em-up style RPG. There is an excited, determined energy that is clear and present throughout.\n\nSo, the final question, should you play Persona 5 Strikers? If you haven't played Persona 5 and you were hoping to start with this game, and are concerned about being confused plot-wise, I would say no. There's a lot of references that might fly over your head, and you could be lost at times (though the game does explain some of the more important backstory things you would need to have some idea of whats going on). If you have played P5, or you don't care about the plot too much and just want a fun RPG/slasher hybrid, then yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Most likely, this game isn't going to change your life like many people have claimed Persona games have before, but it will most definitely provide at least 40+ hours of quality music, fantastic combat and gameplay, decent plot, funny moments between a group of close friends, and a game that will have you wanting more. And who knows, maybe this game will inspire you to play the other ones for the first time, or the tenth time, and that'd be a pretty great outcome too.\n\nWell done, Atlus. Well done, Omega Force.",

        "content": "Strong yes, solid crossover between the Dynasty Warriors style gameplay and Persona's elements. Only tip I would have is beat Persona 5 (Atlus, PC port PLS) before playing P5 Strikers, this game leans pretty heavily on Persona 5's themes, story and characters, so it can be tough to understand some of the story's depth without it.\n\nPros-\n- Great persona combat systems woven into Dynasty-Warriors style gameplay makes for a completely unique experience. Action-based persona combat is crazy fun.\n- Easy to run - not super demanding but strangely doesn't perform well at native 4K on a 2080ti, but that might be a me thing\n- Classic super deep persona story, shorter but not in a bad way. Easily 40-60 hours for someone experienced in the genres, more if you're not.\n- Plenty of additional challenges like Merciless difficulty on NG+, tougher boss fights and others to keep me coming back for more.\n\nCons-\n- No Ultrawide Support - I can forgive this for Persona 4 golden since it's a port of an older Vita game, but this game is new, come on.\n- Locked to either 30 or 60fps - again, modern games shouldn't have hard FPS caps.\n- Depth of the combat system can make things unforgiving for newer players - allowing for tweaking of individual parts of the game's difficulty like Persona 4 Golden has would go a long way for some players.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a great sequel to the original Persona 5 but does not quite match the sheer magnitude of perfection that its predecessor has. I also can't recommend that you buy this game unless you have played the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal because it is a direct sequel and it makes no effort to catch the player up to speed.\n\n\nPersona 5 Strikers' new characters (Zenkichi and Sophia) fit seamlessly into the original cast, both of these new additions bring something new to the table, invoking both memorable dialogue and continuities that tie the main story together. The main story of Persona 5 Strikers follows up on Vanilla P5, it takes place during the summer after the main protagonist returns to his hometown and he makes a return to Yongen-Jaya to meet up with his old friends, aiming to do something fun for the summer. Unfortunately, this time of tranquility only lasts for so long until they meet their new conflict, which I'll leave you to discover.\n\nIt's combat is both addicting and intriguing, drawing the player in with immense strategy and its upbeat persona-esque music engaging its player. It's entirely different from P5's turn based combat but retains its strategy in exploiting weaknesses and debuffing your enemies. \n\nThe only problems I have with P5S is that the dungeons sometimes force fights on you, and it's incredibly difficult to manage SP. Also, I think I had somewhere around 4-5 crashes along my playthrough, so it's important to save often. All in all, P5S is a great game and is most definitely worth checking out.",

        "content": "Do you like beating up hordes of faceless goons in a nightmare world created by the twisted perspectives of highly insecure people? If so, Persona 5 Strikers is the game for you.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about the Persona series in general, or Persona 5 in particular, to enjoy Strikers. P5S is a musou-style beat-em-up/hack-and-slash free-for-all, so if you've ever played any of the Warriors games (Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Hyrule Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors), you know exactly what this is. That's not to say it's bad; in fact, just the opposite. P5S had me smiling from start to finish because it was simply fun, a thing I had long forgotten video games could be. In a world full of roguelikes, open-world sandboxes, MMORPGs, and JRPGs, the Warriors games simply put you in a room with a hundred bad guys and let you mow them down with manic energy. If that's the sort of thing you find gratifying, you'll like P5S.\n\nThis game is set not too long after the events of Persona 5. The band gets back together for a wild summer tour of Japan, but their plans are interrupted when hearts start changing without any apparent cause. The authorities blame the Phantom Thieves, who are forced to investigate and clear their name. Along the way, they encounter a Lewis Carroll enthusiast, have a classic mix-up in a Japanese hot spring, meet a living AI, bury a cop in sand, nearly get pummeled to death by brainwashed islanders, and fight a giant...um...phallus in a chariot (I'm not even kidding).\n\nIn true Persona style, every fight is a bombastic and flashy beatdown. Whereas other musou games do not penalize direct approaches, P5S rewards you for ambushing enemies and getting in opening hits while traversing dungeons. P5S not only draws on the Warriors franchise for inspiration, but also feels at times like the investigation parts of Ace Attorney and the stealth parts of Metal Gear Solid, while bosses and their dungeons often feel inspired by NiGHTS into Dreams. Using the eponymous personas adds a Pokemon-style RPG element as you swap party members and their personas in and out to maximize attack effectiveness. It's a lot of fun and there's a lot of replay value, especially since the game rewards you for revisiting places you've already been to for additional bonuses. The soundtrack is continuously popping off with jazzy, funky melodies during fights that encourage you to do everything from blow party poppers in your enemies' faces to skateboarding into them at high speed.\n\nIf Strikers is the swan song for Persona 5, then it could not have hit a much higher note. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like the over-the-top antics of any Warriors game and you've been wondering who that one character from Smash Ultimate is, then Persona 5 Strikers will take your heart.",

        "content": "[h1] TLDR; Poor PC port that crashes and fails to utilize SSDs, hilariously bad/lazy writing (if you disliked P5's writing, this is worse), and satisfying-but-boring battle gameplay. [/h1]\n\n[b] Fair Warning [/b]: My playtime does not reflect the length of this game, and I have not finished it due to being utterly frustrated with my aforementioned issues.\n\nWhen this got announced for PC, I was pretty excited to get some more breadcrumbs of Persona on the platform, even if it were just a Warriors-style spinoff. However, the final product given has left a LOT to be desired.\n\nThe first thing you may notice, at least if you have the game installed on an SSD, is the straight up abysmal bootup and loading times. Like, at least couple MINUTES to load into the intro screens. This game is definitely not as demanding as the original P5, and that game takes no effort to load on a disk drive for a console that's already out the door. On top of that, the game will constantly freeze and crash on loading screens. I've had 4 crashes in 24 hours, and 2 of those came on the same exact loading screen. The devs, however, do have a beta branch out as of this writing in the hopes of diagnosing and fixing these crashes.\n\nThe second thing you may notice, is how the writing in this release is just straight up not good. Some characters fall further into their awful stereotypes set in the original game (Ryuji & Ann are Dumb & Dumber, Makoto is even more bland, etc.). The two new characters to the group are just straight up depth-less copies of previous Persona franchise characters ( [spoiler] Sophia is super cute but seems to have the same character conflict as Aigis from P3, and Zenkichi has an eerily similar backstory and conflict as Dojima from P4 [/spoiler] ). There's even a bathhouse scene taken straight from Persona 3, except with the interesting bits removed and replaced with a generic slapstick punchline. Some positives to point out, though: the slice-of-life moments in this game feels just as heartwarming as the original game, Morgana is much less annoying, and Haru has way much more character and plays a bigger role in this game than she ever did before.\n\nThe third thing you may notice, the battle gameplay in this game feels confusing at first, but actually feels really clean and satisfying once you grasp it! However that quickly goes away once you realize the gameplay is just: travel to this place, battle a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, defend Futaba against a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, battle a boss and a crowd of enemies to complete part of the level. Repeat about three times and that's an entire arc of this game in the simplest terms possible. The battle gameplay is honestly not that frustrating (except: [spoiler] the massively disappointing Shadow Joker boss battle with an outrageous change in normal gameplay that honestly feels like a dumb gimmick rather than a difficulty spike [/spoiler]). If you enjoy Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, you probably won't have any problems here.\n\nAll in all, this is a ridiculously disappointing game. It's clunky/broken at times, cringey even for Persona standards, and just boring, confusing, and frustrating overall. At least the game's performance problems are in the process of being fixed.",

        "content": "Tl;dr: Great game, not just a Musou clone, well worth checking out.\n\nA worthy successor to Persona 5 and highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the original.\n\nRight out the gate, it's important to note that this is a rather different game to Persona 5 in a number of ways. The most obvious difference of course is the combat, but it isn't the only one by any means. The game lacks the free time aspect and confidants/social links that have become synonymous with the mainline Persona games, though this is likely not much of a surprise to anyone familiar with Persona spin-off titles. The pacing of the story is also quite a bit quicker than the mainline games, with the length of the main story coming in at around 35-40 hours depending on how much time a player spends doing side-content. And unlike the mainline titles, Strikers actually has a proper post-game state with some additional challenges to take on.\n\nOn the flipside, Strikers also has a number of similarities to Persona 5, most notably in the story itself. It becomes apparent early on in the game that the story is going to tread a lot of the same ground as Persona 5. It feels more focused and honestly hits the themes of the game better than Persona 5's story does, but at the same time is hindered by this re-tread - it feels almost as if the writers weren't happy with how P5 turned out in the end and wanted to do it over again. It isn't JUST a re-tread, of course, but anyone who has played Persona 5 Royal will notice a lot of the same new ideas present. To that end, both Strikers and Royal as a whole come together to make what feels like a platform for the developers to move forward with. This repetition in story elements can cause a few eye rolls at times, but if it means that any future titles can step out of the shadow of P5 and progress the plot further, then perhaps it was a worthy sacrifice. There are also a number of plot points that neither P5 nor P5R have done before, and these go a long way in making the game feel like a fresh experience.\n\nNow it's time to touch on what's probably the biggest elephant in the room - Omega Force's involvement in the development of the game. I know many players might worry a little when seeing that logo, as the Musou/Warriors combat style is notoriously repetitive and not particularly suited to a 40 hour RPG, and I was certainly amongst those wary when I first picked up the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun it was, as the game blends both the Musou combat and Persona 5's combat incredibly well. You have access to all of the Phantom Thieves pretty much right from the get-go, and they all have their own attack strings and gimmicks - this isn't anything especially new for a Musou game, of course. What is new, however, is the way Personas are handled, elemental weaknesses, status effects and technical attacks, One More and All-Out Attacks, switching your player character mid-battle and containing fights to smaller areas rather than making the whole map one mass of enemies. \n\nAll of these elements from Persona 5 combined with the variety in gameplay styles come together to create a really enjoyable action-RPG. There are, of course, still moments where you'll be cutting through swathes of enemies, but as the game progresses, tougher enemies that you can't just blindly button mash against become more and more prevalent. You'll find yourself having to use the various Persona 5 systems more frequently, and as the enemies evolve, so too do your playable characters, learning 'Master Arts' which give them new follow-up opportunities or effects to their attacks, and abilities such as Avenger which performs a counter-attack when you evade at the last moment, rewarding skilful play. There are still a few times even late in the game where a battle will be over in a flash by ambushing the enemy, but at that stage it feels almost more like a reward for your progress than a nuisance. The game shines especially well in boss battles, where you'll be dodging enemy attack patterns while using the environment to your advantage and gradually whittling the boss down through their weaknesses - because unlike one of the more frustrating things about mainline series, bosses actually do have elemental weaknesses to exploit and are mostly vulnerable to status effects.\n\nThe developers also absolutely NAILED the presentation of the game - it absolutely feels like an extension of Persona 5, with all the style you'd expect. Though you don't have free time, the game still keeps track of the days over the Summer vacation and the environments all feel right at home. These smaller touches really help to sell the game as a sequel to Persona 5, and you could absolutely convince most people that it's part of the same game at a glance whenever you're not in a dungeon. You gain Bond Exp with the Phantom Thieves that you can turn into buffs and this helps to fill the same kind of thematic idea left behind by Confidants. There are also scenes between many dungeons where you just get to hang out with the characters and get to know them a little more with a fun event, similar to the original game. The new music is absolutely top notch, feeling at home with the rest of the soundtrack while also kicking it up a gear to match the more frantic nature of the combat.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic experience and one I think any fans of Persona 5 should try. It can feel a little slow around the 3rd dungeon at times, but it really picks up the pacing again after that and then never really stops moving until the game ends. As far as technical performance, it ran *mostly* smoothly for me, but a word of caution: switching out of the game window on a loading screen can sometimes cause it to hiccup and load forever. I did have this happen once or twice, but as long as you don't switch window during a loading screen, it runs just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.",

I spent an entire 5 MINUTES in a dialogue after leaving an area, only to enter another, walk LITERALLY one step and then enter into ANOTHER dialogue with a mini-boss and then dialogue after that for another minute. This game really tries to make it hard to be refunded since they waste so much of your time in dialogues and back and forth walking simulators for no other purpose other than \"because we can make you\".",

The combat is a great combination between action and turn-based that keep you going and thinking at the same time. Also music is top notch, story might be cliche but good imo. Also don't be mislead by Haru, she's cute and innocence but she can kill you anytime she wants....",

        "content": "This isn't P5S despite the name. This is Persona 5 - 2. Despite the change in gameplay style it's really just a follow up to P5 in both story and scope. It's a great excuse to have some more fun with the lovable cast of P5 this time on PC. Honestly, Despite what was said by the devs, I don't think this is too much fun for most people who haven't played the original P5 or Royal. Consider playing P5 before this to really get the most out of it. PS3's are pretty cheap nowadays, and if not it's pretty stable on RPCS3 *wink*. If you've played P5, It's an easy 10/10. If not please play P5 and then come here. If there's really no way for you to play P5 then maybe hold out for a sale cause the combat's still fun but honestly this game is more fun if you already love the cast. It goes down to like a 6/10 if you don't know the cast and past events. It doesn't spoil anything from P5 too big and you can still switch up the order but it's not recommended.\nUnlike this game. For me it's one of the few bright spots of this whole lockdown and an easy recommendation.",

        "content": "I'm impressed at how well they were able to implement the style of persona from an action jrpg into a hack and slash, especially since this is the series' first dive into the genre. Characters are consistent with their portrayals in base p5, though it stands to note that this game follows a story where persona 5 royal never happened. This game absolutely lives up to the legacy of the series, and the new characters I really enjoyed. Music was incredible, definitely enough to stand on its own. Setting was incredible. Plot progression was incredible. If anything at all, I feel like the writing in this game did feel a little on the nose and cheesy at times, but not at all enough to affect my overall opinion.\n\n[h1]SPOILERS [/h1]\n[spoiler]The final boss was easy. Like, really easy. Throughout my entire playthrough, I pretty much exclusively stuck with Joker (for obvious reasons), Haru (for heat riser and the fact that killing enemies with her rocket launcher was funny), Sophia (because she had a great moveset), and Yusuke (though I switched him out with Zenkichi during the Kyoto jail). While they were hovering in the mid level 70s by the final boss, my other team members ended under level 60. When you had to split up and fight the meatballs on the towers, I had no trouble spamming their moves and made it out without a single person dying. Even when you get all the meatballs and Joker has to kill EMMA, I just spammed Maeigaon and killed it without taking any damage. Honestly the Archangel in the room right before EMMA was more challenging in my opinion. The hardest boss of the entire game was Shadow Joker, and that's only because you do such little damage to him. I only got out of that boss fight by spamming health and sp healing items and wailing on him for a solid 10 minutes. Finally, I want to bring attention to Zenkichi. He absolutely stole the show in the entire game. There was so much passion that went into his performance, and, when paired with the writing of his character, made him the best part of the entire game. Also, as a temporary musical nerd, seeing Valjean appear in the awakening scene was an out of body popoff experience. The portrayal of Valjean as a persona was perfect (it even had the 24601 on his chest). But seeing Valjean specifically as the persona of Zenkichi was the most incredible thing because Valjean fits so perfectly with Zenkichi's character. AND it drew the parallel of Akane being Zenkichi's Claudette like oh my god that was absolutely genius.[/spoiler]\n\nHonestly, it's astounding to me what they were able to accomplish with this game, and it absolutely gave me the same feeling of unending emptiness of the mainline persona games when it ended (which is crazy because no social links and also half the playtime wow).",

        "content": "This is my first game from the Persona-series. I have watched a bit of Persona 5, but that was it. I also haven't watched any content to P5Strikers, or better, P5Scramble. This is why I was surprised that it was a Hack-n-slash game, however, it works really well with the setting. And the story, oh boy, good characters, good plot and overall a great experience. Every character has its onw playstyle, be it the allrounder Joker who has really save moves, Ryuji who has massive burst-options that leave him wide open for attacks or Makoto or Morgana who specialize in buffing and healing their teammates. If you like the Persone-style and look for a good hack-n-slash, play this, it's like a 40-hour game and worth every single cent. The only downside to this game is its instability, it sometime crashes, not often, but often enough for you to start saving all the time, however, you can't save during cutscenes or textboxes, you have to wait till cutscenes are over and just pray. If there is a hot-fix, ill give it a perfect score of 10/10, but till now it is a 9.5/10.\nMusic is, as expected from the Persona-games, great. I can't choose between \"Life will change\", \"Aria of the soul\" and \"Anti-HERO\".",

        "content": "Thank you Atlus for bringing P5S on PC! \n\nWonderful game, full of emotions (as usual) and i'd say that the story got actually even deeper in the topic than in P5. \n\nI loved the original game veeery much and I enjoyed this one as well. They are different in terms of gameplay and I would say that Strikers is much easier but nevertheless it delivers and touches.... The only usual thing of Persona series that kinda dissapoints me is their endings which are usually bittersweet and leave you with emptiness and need for a hug :)\n\nI should add that one thing that an asian (japanese in particular) cuisine foodie should be prepared for getting really hungry periodically while playing, 'cos the characters like to eat different stuff and discuss it in a very appetizing manner :)",

        "content": "Interesting experience for fans of dynasty warrior type games, disappointing experience for a persona fan. Graphics for the game even on the max graphics settings are OK at best. The models in persona 5 are so much more crisp while the models in persona 5 strikers are blurry and hard to look at when far away. After playing persona 5, I have to admit that the characters have gotten stale for me. All of the arcs that the characters went through in persona 5 are pretty much just reused in this game, making it seem very lazy to say the least. A character that really grinds my gears is Sophia. Her character development is pretty much a sh*tty version of a certain someones character development in persona 3. No social links is also a real bummer. It was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed persona 5 and without them the game really feels like its missing something. Another thing I would like to point out is the fact that they make you go back into the real world and sit through two loading screens just to recover your SP. And its not like there's any incentive to go back to the real world. There's no social links, the day doesn't change, and the area your in remains exactly the same until you manage to drag yourself through the jail. Every time you try to do a persona attack it freezes time disrupting any natural flow the game could have had. As for the soundtrack, there's a few soundtracks I like and a few that are pretty terrible. The soundtrack I found most enjoyable was the soundtrack to the first jail, Love te Wonderland. Otherwise, it mostly goes downhill from there. Overall, the games not terrible and may be enjoyable to fans of the hack and slash genre, but to everyone else I wouldn't recommend it.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Scramble: the Phantom Strikers is very good. When I first heard about Scramble and how it was going to be a W-Force game, I was so disappointed since I'm not a fan of musou games and their formula. But this is far from your typical base defense/attack Musou game, it is far more like Persona 5 in it's gameplay, but instead of turn based battles, you have Musou style combat. There isn't any dumb base defense. All the levels feel like levels from Persona 5, and you only goal is to beat the enemies you are attacking at the moment.\n\nThe story is what you would come to expect from a Persona story if you've played all the games and spin-offs. It does some special things, and I wish it delved deeper into some characters [spoiler]I wish they just said that Ichinose was coping with autism or something and explored her more, but she serves her purpose, I just had to read between the lines to not see her as shounen villain of the week.[/spoiler] \n\nBut the with the gameplay and story, I'd say this is the best Persona spin-off ever. I wouldn't say it's Persona 5-2. But I would easily consider this Persona 5-1.5. Persona 4 Arena is a great fighting game that takes great advantage of what Persona is, but this feels like an actual continuation of a mainline Persona game in both gameplay and story.\n\nOne thing you may not like is characters over explaining things, or back and forths where characters just repeat the same things at each other, more so than Persona 5, but if you look past that, or enjoy that stuff, then it should be fine.\n\nSadly the localization is pretty crummy. ATLUS West is 10 years behind in their localization style. I'd say it's even worse than Persona 5, but at least there didn't seem to be anything censored here. Part of the issue is not having dedicated translations for both the English dub and for the real audio. There are so many issues with the translation that I think most everyone will notice if they play with the real audio, regardless of your level of Japanese. Also the Western name is so bad and unneeded and psychotic. The name change from \"Persona 5 Scramble: the Phantom Strikers\" to \"Persona 5 Strikers\" is indicative of the localization changes you should expect in the game itself. I took over 250 screenshots of lines that I felt were inaccurate, as well as some notes, and I hope one day we can fix these problems.\n\nFor technicalities of the PC version: it can run crustily. Music seems to stop in certain places, there are minor frame drops on my 5 year old GPU. There are crashes during loading screens. I think the biggest issue for me is how bad anti-aliasing is. I needed to play at 1440p to get an acceptable level of non-jaggedness, and that ate away at performance. Plus the game doesn't have built in supersampling, so you need to change the resolution of your computer yourself.\n\nThere are quite a few FMVs, which is a shame, but I'll accept that this is probably a limitation of the engine. The cutscene quality makes up for their existence. But FMVs have a problem where they can stutter sometimes, and during an emotional moment, that sucks. Also FMVs should have been rendered at 60fps.\n\nSo, good game, needs some technical work. Denuvo sucks and brings the quality down for me, but not enough for this to be a negative review. Biggest issue is the outmoded translation. Only modders will be able to fix that. I hope I can contribute in some way.",

As usual from P5 the presentation in terms of audio and voice acting as well as the visual presentation is crisp and to an really high standard. \n\nThe gameplay is that of a warriors game though with the RPG elements of persona fitting in in a really natural way. If you don't like the gameplay of other warriors games then you probably wont enjoy this one, though if you want more of the P5 cast and story then i can still recommend playing on easy mode and it may surprise you.\n\nI can make that recommendation since this is one of the best warriors style games out there. All of the characters are fun to play and the combat is so satisfying, it tones down a lot of the warriors series main features to allow for the new content but that rounds off the experience really well to make for a game thats just fun to play.\n\nTLDR\n\nIf you liked the base P5 or are a fan of good warriors games then give this a go. If you don't like the genre then perhaps its worth skipping. But everything this game does it does really well.",

        "content": "Despite being a much shorter game than your typical Persona game, Strikers still manages to tell a very compelling story that allows for characters to shine and really let their personalities steal the show. Once I started playing, I'll admit a part of me wasn't totally sold on the concept as a whole yet. I had never played a Musuo/Dynasty Warriors game before but knew that I had to see what the next chapter for the Phantom Thieves had in store for us. Sure enough, the further I progressed, the more the game grew on me and the more I bought into the transition Persona 5 went through to become a game like this. In reality, the essence of what makes Persona 5 such a compelling and lovable game was really what shined through in the end. The cast was full of life, love, fantastic personalities and unforgettable moments. Every character had moments that really let them take center stage and remind us all of what it means to overcome our own struggles and once again stand up on our own two feet. Personally, I wan't to give a special shout out to Haru, who was the final character to join the team in Persona 5. One of the things I wished we had in P5 was more time to spend with Haru and more opportunities for her to shine and that is exactly was Strikers gives us. This goes for all characters as well. I enjoyed getting to tag along with the Phantom Thieves for another journey through the human heart that resulted in some strong and powerful character moments that empowered the story to really hit home for myself and I'm sure for plenty of people, especially after everything we've been through and are still going through with COVID. It's crazy to think how towards the beginning of the pandemic we were graced with Persona 5 Royal and now a year later, we're given a worthwhile next chapter for the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. A few things to touch on before wrapping this up.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nThe entire Persona series is known for its exceptional soundtracks and Strikers is no slouch in that department. Whether its the remixes of classic P5 tunes or the newcomers to the party making you stop what you're doing and groove in your chair, this game has no shortage of tunes for all manor of situations to aid you in your Phantom Thief duties! I plan on adding this soundtrack to my collection of Persona tunes that I already listen to on a daily basis.\n\n[h1] Crashes [/h1]\nThroughout my roughly 45 hours of game time, I had 3 total crashes happen while playing on PC. Thankfully, none of these crashes happened at crucial moments but it is something I've seen people write about in other reviews so make sure to save as often as possible!\n\n[h1] Story Continuation from Persona 5 [/h1]\nWhile ultimately not super important for the overall story, this game definitely assumes that you have played P5 before and are familiar with it's story so be mindful if you haven't played P5 before and are considering getting this game!\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\nAny opportunity to team back up with the Phantom Thieves is easily one worth taking and Strikers does a great job delivering on a worthy sequel to what was already my favorite game of all time. Hopefully the overwhelming amount of positive feedback will encourage Atlus to keep releasing Persona games on steam since its clear that the Phandom, old and new, are eager for more! P5 fans will adore this game but ultimately, any fans of good storytelling and meaningful character development will fall in love just as easily! Thanks for everything, Phantom Thieves <3",

        "content": "It's quite excellent.\n\nIf you really enjoyed Persona 5, you probably already picked this up.  If you haven't yet, definitely do so, it's an excellent follow-up.\n\nThe story, characters, Persona Fusing, weakness-exploiting, all of it feels like an excellent continuation from Persona 5, just wapped up in an Action Game format instead of a turn-based JRPG, while ALSO giving you ways to pause the action (summoning personas and pulling out the guns) to assess the situation and respond thoughtfully.\n\nDespite the marketing and the combo system, this is NOT a Warriors/Musou game.  It may use the basic button combo system from one, but it's far more deliberate.  There are very few enemy hordes, with most encounters being small gangs of enemies that are mostly all a threat (even the mooks).\n\nFinally, I like that once the lengthy tutorial is over, the game TRUSTS the player.  You get a huge party of 8, with all their combos unlocked the minute you enter the first dungeon for real, with all further unlocks either being powerups, or critical game-changing abilities.  There's very little unlocking required to access your core essential abilities and you can start doing cool and awesome stuff from the word go.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the 2nd Persona game to make it onto the Steam store and is the sequel to Persona 5.  It brings with it a compelling story, engaging combat and amazing music.  While technically a musou game, the game plays very much like a Persona game in most respects.  The majority of this review compares the differences between this game and Persona 5 and Musou games to give you a good sense of what you are getting yourself into.  \n\n[h1] Whats Changed [/h1]\n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nCombat is by far the biggest difference between Persona 5 in this game.  The Combat has changed from a Turn Based System to an Active Time System, though it executes this spectacularly.  All of the iconic features of Persona are still present in this new combat system such as Weakness exploitation, All Out Attacks, and Stat/Ailment effects.  You also initiate combat just like you would in any other Persona game, by attacking an enemy on the field which sends you into a real time battle on the map.  \n\nWhile this is labeled as a Musou game, the only thing it really has in common with them is the number of enemies present on the screen usually consisting of a large number of trash mobs and a few enemies that actually pose a threat.  In addition, since it is Real Time, enemy attacks are now telegraphed and nearly all attacks are preventable by dodging out of the way or interrupting the enemy.  While this might be a bit hard to execute in trash mob fights with tons of enemies, this really shines in boss fights where there is one major threat to focus on.  \n\nOverall, this new Combat System is intertwined excellently with the Persona series, making you wonder why they have never done this before.  \n\n[b] Confidant System [/b]\n\nThe next big difference between this game and Persona 5 is the Confidant System, which was replaced with Bond Levels.  Unfortunately, this new system is quite limited as a whole, as it comprises only of party member interaction and lacks any NPCs to interact with and gain confidant levels with.  In addition, the time management system is all but gone as a result.  However, this new system still allows you to gain the benefits of the Confidant System by giving you Bond Exp with interactions, which you can use to buy perks very similar to what you would gain from Confidants.  \n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n \n[b] Story [/b]\n\nThe story is compelling as ever and while not quite as good as the main Persona series, still holds its own quite well, especially for a Musou game which typically don't have great stories. \n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nThe Music remains a strong point of the game and the series as a whole, with a number of remixed pieces from Persona 5 as well as plenty of new additions.  \n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\n[b] Crashes [/b]\n\nIn 50 hours of this game, I've had the game crash 5 times.  Each of these crashes occurred at either entering or exiting a dungeon, so often not much progress was lost.  However, since this game does not auto save, you have to be careful to save often to prevent losing significant progress.  \n\n[b] Lack of Prequel Explanation [/b] \n\nThis game absolutely expects you to have played Persona 5 prior to playing this game, as there is little explanation of character's backstories or prior events.  Often times, the game references major plot points of the previous game but does nothing to even mention what happened, leaving people who haven't played the previous game confused.  While normally not too much of a problem, it is not even possible to play Persona 5 on Steam as of this review.  \n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is an extremely strong spinoff of Persona 5 with compelling gameplay and story.  However, it lacks some of the major features that some Persona fans love so much and also requires you to have played the first game in order to properly enjoy the story.",

Atlus won't bring P5 to the PC? dude, they make the Royal only because they couldn't stop PS3 emu to be real. go play P5 on the PS3 emulator and then come play this great game.\n\nit's not dynasty warriors at all, don't get fooled. it's really a pretty good game. True, it's different than regular persona games, but still the same.\nit got some features that actually even better than what's in regular persona game, u will miss some stuff, but u will enjoy what's in here.\nthe game is 50~70 hours depending on how u want to play the game, side quest isn't bad at all.\nthe story itself is really interesting and pretty solid.\n\noverall rating? dunno, but it's above 8/10",

        "content": "Great gameplay, awful writing. The dialogue is really uninspired and just seems like it was thrown at the wall to see what sticks. There's no real character or moral development from Persona 5, just more of the same. Our main heroes act like they've never had any life experiences outside of what the game shows you, as if they're just actors in a show. Regardless, the game is fun, I just find myself cringing at the rather second-rate plot points and superficial character development.\n\nEDIT: After completing the game, and likely going on to 100% it, I'll change my review to recommend. The writing and storytelling is still quite sub-par, but the gameplay is still exponentially fun, even as a musou-style.",

        "content": "Let me first say: IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED YET PERSONA 5 OR PERSONA 5 ROYAL, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, THIS IS A DIRECT SEQUEL TO THOSE GAMES. \nIt\u00b4s very hard for me to make a objectively review of this game because Persona 5 Royal is my N\u00b0 1 favorite game of all time. When I first listened that we were going to have a new Persona experience with a new battle system which replace the turn based combat, it was really exciting news, but I also thought that it was going to be just a musou/warriors game with a persona art style, and hoo boy how I was wrong about that assumption.\n From the music to the art style,  and to the story and the combat, it really felt like a Persona 5 game. The implementation of some of the previous games combat system mechanics to this new musou/warriors style combat fitted perfectly. Each of the phantom thieves combat skills are unique and different from each other. About the music, they never cease to amaze me. Each of the music tracks are phenomenal and outstanding. If they release a Persona 5 Farming Simulation game with new music like this and the previous games, I\u00b4ll keep giving them my money.\n The visual novel story part is still in this game and very well adapted, and although the social link aspect of the previous game is replaced with this new bond level system, I think it adapts really well to the format of this game. The story and new characters in my opinion are very well written, and it is really easy to attach to them, as usual.\n If I had to criticize something, perhaps it would be that some of the characters from the previous game are not in this one, either way, the main roaster is here. \nTo conclude, if you have previously played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, definitely you have to play this game without any doubt. I repeat, if you have not played those games, then go play them first. THIS IS A SEQUEL. Let\u00b4s pray that Atlus release Persona 5 Royal and the other Persona games on Steam soon.\nLooking cool Joker.",

If you liked Persona 5, you'll like this too because it's essentially more P5. Stylish, fun team interactions, great music, a decent story (especially for a spin-off), and just the all-around polish that I've come to expect. My main takeaway from this and the fact that the SMT Nocturne Remaster is coming to Steam (announced yesterday as of writing this) is that Atlus is on PC to stay, and that's what I really love about this. These games coming to PC means that P4G made them realize they can print money by giving games to people on the platform they want, and I'm all for it.",

        "content": "the games uhhhhh, fine? but not worth the price at all if you cut out padding.\ni'd describe it as one of those DBZ games, where its kinda garbage but theres enough there to satisfy you.\n\nthey tried to do more than just Persona 5 Warriors and it works out on a surface level, but when you get down to the nitty gritty aspects of the game it feels stretched out extremely far and much less inspired (in some points just being unfinished too)\n\nSPOILERS:\n[spoiler]The 2nd \"Jail\" is a parody of lazy writing in fiction, the problem is thats all it is, theres no story to it other than a single joke that runs its course 5 minutes into a several hour story arc.\n\nThe third Jail uses the exact same assets with an ice filter, and the aesthetic is tied to a really really really actually lazy story (so far, yet to complete it), so while the game is making fun of lazy tropey writing, it turns around and falls to that problem without realizing it.[/spoiler]\n\nThe combats genuinely very fun, but then the game forces itself into persona 5 mechanics and kneecaps itself due to it.\n\nFirst off, like persona 5 you \"ambush\" enemies and that starts the actual encounters and this is cool and allows for fast grinding later on, it also means theres a short cutscene and waiting period every time you try to start combat. It feels super bad to play, especially if you are trying to do the constant backtracking side missions which just require you grind X enemy in Y dungeon Z times.\n\nAgain from the original game, abilities use HP/SP but unlike the original game there isnt a ticking clock that makes you want to get as far through the palace as possible in one go. In strikers you can leave the dungeon at any checkpoint (which are very common) and instantly return with full stats. So unless you like fighting health spongey bosses with no stats youl be jumping in and out of dungeons often early on when you dont have many tools/items.\n\nTonnes of the game (especially the shibuya areas) feel fake, the attention to detail and things you can do are significantly limited, while this is understandable it just makes it feel strange to have 7 different shops next to each other that all sell 2 things when you have no real reason to actually touch them at all outside the cooking mechanic (which isnt a mechanic as much as a way to make a shitload of items quickly, if you bought ingredients earlier)\n\nIn the end the game just feels like the people making it liked persona 5 (and probably previous SMT games) but didnt really like the downtime aspects of persona 5, or had no idea how to implement it with the road trip aesthetic.\n\nI really wish it was just a lazy Persona 5 Warriors game, because im having fun in extremely quick bursts followed by worse handholding than original p5.",

        "content": "This game is kinda low for persona standards overall , The game is a bit buggy by the time I write this (still playable tho), The pacing of the story was off , the plot was kinda meh & predictable (it feels like I'm watching a bunch of filler anime episodes) , The combat system is what you'd expect from a musou game, It's a nice change of pace from your regular turn based combat (tho I still preferred the classic). The difficulty Is pretty well done in the early stages but as you proceed it gets way too easy at the point where you could mash 2 buttons to win easily even at the highest difficulty. positives were the music remix were so good ngl. If you're a massive Persona fanboy or you wanna fund atlus to port more Persona games in the future maybe you should give this game a go , Otherwise get this at a discount. don't put your expectations too high. personal opinion : 6/10",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is exactly what I was hoping for as a Persona 5 spinoff/sequel. It continues the story of P5 in a similar, yet new way and continues to build the characters of P5.\n\nI found the gameplay very enjoyable, with it's unconventional turn-based RPG mechanics mixed in with the action gameplay. The action felt just right, you're able to dash around and attack just like in devil may cry but at the push of a button every stops and it becomes much more like a turn based rpg.\nI don't think they could have implemented this much better, so kudos.\n\nJust like the original the soundtrack is great. I personally prefer it to the original P5, but this is just my style of music. They even added in some Remixes of the original games music.\n\nLastly the story. I find it very good. It has been streamlined with story progression now being tied to your in-game progression, since there is no calendar system. I'm sure it would have been nice to see all characters from P5 return, but think it's better this way. The new additions fit in well too (mostly).\nThe real crime with the story of this game is a PC and switch exclusive problem. The original games aren't on these platforms and therefore many people are most likely going to be out of the loop when starting the game. Therefore they may miss some of the more subtle things, not understand everything or just not care. \n\nIn terms of the port, I did not have any big issues. Some framedrops when things got heated. I did have a few crashes, but only about six or seven in 70+ hours of playtime. Sidenote: This was also within the first two weeks of the games release. I have not tried 1.02 but I assume that is even better. \n\nOverall I recommend this game. It's really great. My biggest issue with it is that the NG+ difficulty might as well be called BS mode, so yeah. Great game. Worth your money.\n...\nBut there's a catch.\nI recommend you at least have basic knowledge of the previous game. I got through just fine knowing the base plot of the P5 and having watched the anime(yes the anime does cover most of the important things). Let's just hope that Atlus do eventually port Persona 5 (Royal) to PC, but I think it's basically a given at this point. :)",

        "content": "[b] Pros: [/b] \n- Continues the story from Persona 5, with new themes. Leads to an engaging, although familiar, experience. Seeing the Phantom Thieves hanging out and having fun in different locales is a treat.\n- The UI is still as stylish as ever. \n- Music is awesome and varied. The new rock-infused tracks fit right in with the jazz music from the original game.\n- Sophia and Zenkichi are great additions to the cast, both having great characterizations and deep and complex backstories.\n- Gameplay is action-packed and hectic. Puts a spin in the typical Musou-formula. Each character have their own unique fighting styles, allowing for different experiences.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b] \n- The gameplay is rather repetitive. You'll be mowing down enemies again, again and again with no signs of stopping. \n- Bossfights are tedious and will test your patience. It will take quite a while to whittle down a boss's health to even half-health. Even mini-bosses aren't exempt from this. \n- Crashes and long loading times happen but are rare. Save often to prevent loss of progress.\n\nAll-in-all, as a Persona 5 fan, I love the game and enjoyed most of it. Love the story, the interactions between the crew, and the new characters. The gameplay is fun enough, although I'm not the biggest fan of it.\n",

Luckily I never was hit with it or any other major bugs. I think in my opinion Atlus did a great job with the release of Persona 5 Strikers on Steam.\n\nI 100%'d Persona 4 Golden a little before this came out early. And a little while ago I 100%'d this.\n\nNow we just need a Persona 5 Royal port so I don't have to deal with the inferior version on a console released almost a decade and a half ago, I already have over 400 hours on a New Game+ save on it anyways.\n\nI can't wait to try out the SMT III: Nocturne remaster once I get the chance to.",

        "content": "Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Persona 5 fan, having played the base game several times and Royal twice. I went in to this game only seeing the trailers when they first came out. I'm not big on games similar to Dynasty Warriors, but I still feel like the gameplay was fairly enjoyable for the most part. My biggest issue comes from the story. Sometimes the story can feel touching, but other times it feels so bland and generic. Dialogue got SUPER REPETITIVE, by the end of the game I was skipping parts of the dialogue because it was unnecessary filler. The crashing was also a bit of an issue I had, but it was pretty minor. It only crashed like 4-5 times during my playthrough, so just make sure to save often just in case.\n\nCharacters-\nSince this game follows the events of Persona 5, the characters are something I need to talk about. They had their moments, but they felt nothing like the characters from P5. They all felt a bit 1-dimensional at times, like they had a single character trait and that was it. They ended up feeling more like cardboard cutouts than actual characters. Even some of the new characters fall into this troupe, some more than others. I will say that I enjoyed Zenkichi and Sophia quite a bit in this game. Zenkichi and Sophia almost always had meaningful dialogue that added to their character or those around them. Even though the characters can feel stale at times, some of them had their moments that made me smile or laugh. \n\nRecommendation-\nI don't recommend it, but I'm not entirely against it either. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you:\n-Are a big fan of P5 or the Persona franchise as a whole\n-Aren't playing for an immersive story(at least on the level of P5)\n-Are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior genre\n-Don't mind repetitive dialogue/gameplay\n-Just want to play it for the gameplay/characters\n-Just want to try it for yourself\n\n\nGameplay-\n\u2610  Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\nGraphics-\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful \n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\nAudio\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\nAudience\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\nStory-\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Not great\n\u2610 None\n\nDifficult-\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610  Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nGrind-\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\nGame Time-\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\nPrice\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\n\nOverall Score: 68/100",

        "content": "Its advisable that you at least have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal as this game is a direct sequel from the previous ones. Game itself Is quite good despite the RPG turn style based changes for a more musou although not completely style live action RPG. In terms of difficulty the same is just right but it can be hard sometimes even on normal in which the player will need to play more smart and master the combat systems rather than using only button mashing. \n\nSoundtrack is superb with remixes from previous P5 and P5R themes and new ones with a lasting impression. \n\nAll in all, recommended but only if you have played the previous titles.",

So you will need to have played that to understand what is going on. \nStory wise, it is not as good as the original, but it definitely has its moments, and I think its a good sequel that doesn't feel forced.\nAs far as the combat, at first it can feel really off putting because of the Dynasty Warriors style, to remedy this, you can bump up the difficulty to hard. the mini bosses and bosses are actually pretty fun this way and the gameplay elements blend together pretty well.\nDefinitely give this a try if you enjoyed the original Persona 5. it is well worth it.",

The gameplay style change fits so well, the story and the Phantom Thieves were just as great as the first one (maybe even better), the two new characters were written so well and I still listen to the soundtrack and probably will for a long time.\n\nHonestly this game is the perfect sequel for me. Any doubts I had were blown out of the water as this game delivered so much more than I was expecting. If you've played Persona 5 I have no doubt you'll love this game.\n\n10/10 Zenkichi best gramps",

        "content": "Some things to know: \nIf you haven't played base game or Royal please do yourself a favor and play them. This is a direct sequel so reasons are obvious as to why you should play the base game or Royal. Even though this game is technically a spin off it still has its own full story and new characters. This game if you don't know is a warriors game meaning hacking through a lot of mobs, so no turned base combat.\n\nThe Pros: \n-The cast is back and they are just as great as base game. All feel exactly the same as they did from the end of P5 and they retain their growth from the previous game. The interactions with them are all great and that alone was a massive selling point for me.\n- The fighting system is fluid and requires you to think especially in later encounters making combat not just button mashing. \n-All characters are very distinct in their fighting styles and all feel really fun to play.\n-Zenkichi and Sophia are a great addition to the cast and fit right in with the thieves.\n-Haru gets some well deserved screentime after what she dealt with in base-game. \n-Jails are similar to palaces yet unique in their own rights making exploring them feel nostalgic and enjoyable.\n-Music is really good and I still find myself listening to the tracks even after playing.\n-The Va's did an amazing job especially under the restrictions of covid and each character sounds amazing and never really took me out of the experience.\n-Merciless is a great edition and makes the game much harder than before making combat require even more thinking especially for certain combos/ making broken personas in the velvet room.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The first couple of jails fit the same exact formula which is understandable for plot reasons however, it does make each one feel less unique.\n-The game will crash rarely when entering new locations which of course can be not fun especially when you did not save prior. This seems to be a PC problem only.\n-I occasionally received some frame drops in later encounters especially with fights with lots of effects but it runs very well everywhere else.\n-The requests can sometimes feel very grindy and menial which of course can be annoying especially when they are required to fight the reaper and unlock new-game+/merciless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is great and I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5. It has its flaws for sure but this game is still amazing. It carries a lot over from base-game which I don't mind but does make the game feel more like an extension rather than a sequel. Its an amazing experience and to all those who haven't gotten into the Megaten series you definitely should these are some of it not the best games ever made.\nScore: 4/5",

        "content": "Okay, so for a PC port this was really good. \nMy only problem with the game itself: \nThe one major problem I had was the game randomly crashing, which was a rare occurrence ( happened only like 2-3 times in the 60+ hours i've played) so as long as you've saved regularly, it shouldn't be a problem. What I can't quite figure out is why it crashed? One of the times it happened I was just walking from one area of the real world to another, it wasn't even if a particularly crowded area with a lot of NPC's. The first time it happened it happened during a dialogue scene (the one in the attic towards the start of the game), which should be even less likely because it wasn't even loading anything at the time. Of course, I am hyping this up to be more of a problem then it actual is, and there is a chance that it may just be something my computer is doing. \n\nstory wise:\nHonestly, I don't know what to say that hasn't been said. This is a sequel game, if you played the original, you'll like this one, if you haven't you'd probably find a lot of the character beats uninteresting. The sole exception to that is the two new thieves, one of which is just adorable and the other of which is one of the funniest characters in any video games I have ever played.  Also, keep in mind that this game is a lot shorter then the original, which to be fair was a long game, but even beyond time spent, the first couple of dungeons were fillery, not bad, just not particularly important. I still had fun with it though.\n\nGame play:\nNo, it is not turn based, and yes the new combat can take a little bit to get used to, but its fun in its own way and I really enjoyed it and it makes this game feel like its own distinct thing and not just Persona 5 expect smaller and a tacked on story.",

        "content": "While this is a longer review, this does not talk much about any combat/spoilers present in the game. This is instead a look at the game from a series perspective, so there may be other reviews more suited to your taste if this is not what you're looking for. I am not including a TL:DR because the review is a little scatterbrained despite it's length. If this helps even one person then I'm glad.\n\nIn many ways, Persona 5 Strikers is like a sequel to Persona 5. This isn't an original statement, as many describe the game this way, but the fact that it can be described as a sequel speaks volumes for one simple reason: P5S is just a spinoff. Atlus, along with the other studio that helped produced this work, were so bold as to mix ideas from the long-standing Persona/SMT with combat likened to Nier:Automata and Devil May Cry. It's very well done; the aesthetic that makes 5 stand out is still present here, and it is very faithful to the original game. I wouldn't say that it follows up perfectly after the release of Persona 5 Royal, (because this game released in Japan about a month before Royal went worldwide) so don't expect any of the characters/content from Royal here. I will say that a lot of the ideas for Royal were taken from this game, such as the thought process behind the Showtime! mechanic, so if you're familiar with some of the more recognizable content they added in Royal which was not present in the base Persona 5, you'll be glad to find it here. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers does contain some slight spoilers for Persona 5, so be warned if you haven't experienced 5 that there may be some things that are present here which could surprise you. I want to mention one key aspect that this game made me constantly think about though: the only thing holding Persona 5 Strikers, a SPINOFF title, from feeling like a main series game, was the lack of any confidant/social link mechanic. While this is disappointing, the fact that this can even be considered a downside should speak volumes for the game itself. There are only two instances in the game where any activity related to hanging out with a friend from the confidant/social link mechanics in other Persona games exist here. However, it should be considered greatly that following the events from Persona 5, you should not even need a confidant/social link bond with the characters in this game, considering that aside from the two new additions, you've already met and experienced hardship as well as friendship with every other character as the Phantom Thieves. \n\nAnother major advantage this game has is replayability and content. In your first playthrough, if you are even just a little adventurous, you will likely fuse most of the personas and have done just about all of the unique mini bosses present. Although, unlike in base 5 and Royal, the hardest difficulty for this game is locked behind a first completion of the game and then the completion of the post-game content. Let me say that if you're like me, and want a challenge from a game, the hard difficulty from a generic playthrough provides more difficulty than Persona 5/Royal's hardest difficulty. The hardest difficulty in this game is much, much more difficult than that. So trust me when I say that this game has enough content and replayability value, especially for those who want the challenge and unique achievements you can only gain through a merciless NG+ run. \n\nAs a final statement for this review, which has been all over the place, there is one more thing I want to mention. Fans of Persona 5 love the game for a lot of reasons; it's not a huge stretch to say it's a masterpiece in it's very flooded genre, which happens to be one of my favorite game genres. In my (and many others) experience, the music for Persona 5 is the one of the best parts of the whole experience. I am especially happy to say that the new music found in Persona 5 Strikers, be it the new battle themes and remixes of old battle themes or the background/tone setting music, is fan-fu**in-tastic. My personal favorite songs are \"Crossover\" and \"Counter Strike\", so be sure to check them out if you love the music but aren't sure about getting the game. Thanks to anyone who happened to read through this, and sorry for not having a TL:DR. If this helps even one person make the decision either to or not to buy the game, then that is enough for me. Let's hope for more PC releases and ports for this series and SMT!",

Then a month after release, to address these issues, they release a beta instead of a patch. This is insulting, and I'll never play this game on any format because this experience (including making me pay $10 for the deluxe edition just to play it on the actual release date) has ruined it for me.

That battle system and the amazing soundtracks combined make battles a lot more fun and addicting to play.\nAlso the game runs smoothly, 60 fps and well animated character models makes it pleasant to the eyes, ALTHOUGH I have experienced a lot of random crashes during loading times, making hours of playtime go to waste because there is no auto save feature which can make you pissed off.\nThis game is a solid recommendation to the people who enjoyed P5 and P5 Royal and want to see more of the Phantom Thieves.",

        "content": "If you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona you enjoy the game. I'd give this title a 3.5 out of 5 being honest. It's like the best of both worlds but it does everything slightly worse. Example:\n\nPersona 5: Confidants, city activities, new game plus upon completion of the title. \nPersona 5 Strikers: No confidants (replaced by team friendship or whatever its called), all of the previous confidants are gone on vacation in the city and you will never see them. New Game Plus is only unlocked after 100% the game.....which removes the purpose behind the new game plus. I'm not going to play through again for 1 persona.\n\nDynasty Warriors: Large Uninterrupted battles\nPersona 5 Strikers: Have to enter battles the persona way by ripping off the opponents masks then attacking. \n\nNice addition/subtraction: The negotiation system is gone. While I eventually got good at it in 5/R, the minigame was kinda pointless. Just collecting a persona via battling is a welcomed changed.\n\nGood: Can enter/exit dungeons without day constraints. It doesnt pass time. There isn't much to do outside of missions anyways but hey at least they removed this as well. \n\nCombat system is fun. It's not a straight up ripoff of Dynasty warriors and all of the characters feel unique. \n\nStory is meh, predictable, and kinda wears out its welcome. For the first time ever playing a persona series I found myself wanting the game to end. I always loved the story telling between P4G, P3P, and P5/R. When you take away the great story, complex palaces now replaced by really large prisons, and confidants, the game doesn't feel the same. \n\nI was pleased with amount of Persona available and some actually have unique moves. Would I recommend full price? Nope. But do I regret my purchase? No. \n\nThis game's sweet point would be about 40 bucks for someone who's a die hard fan of Persona. I also almost forgot, the performance on this game is wonky. Sometimes it's amazing then sometimes things just break and I just don't get it. I've occasionally seen the shadow on the table of your vehicle doing weird things that snatch your attention. I was in the city and it turned black multiple times and I couldn't see anything. And frame rate randomly drops. I have a 3090 playing between 1080p and 1440p.",

        "content": "In terms of writing, its one of the best Persona spin-offs \n\nThis feels like a genuine sequel to Persona 5 with Characters feeling exactly as they did in Persona 5. Which sounds obvious. but considering how in Persona Q characters were overly simplified with beloved characters like Chie/Akihiko hyperfixating on Meat/Protein its a massive improvement. The new characters are fun and interesting. Zangetshi the cop character is a especially fun character. Sophie can be kinda annoyingly roboty at points, sometimes stopping the story to ask about complicated emotions. which my dumbass usually ends up telling her \"uh yeah the human heart is a complicated thing or whatever lets get back to the story.\" but shes also a really fun character. \n\nNow in terms of gameplay its a dynasty warriors game with platforming, which is what interested me, i've played games like hyrule warriors and felt the terrains were incredibly flat with a shitload of enemies to beat the shit out of. i figured the platforming would change it up a bit to allow more verticality. Which to the game's benefit. it does and its fun as hell to zip around the cities jumping from rooftop to rooftop or jumping off cars in the street. \n\nMy problems are the actual battles, you either have random encounters that last 5 seconds or bosses that have \"Weakness shields.\" And if you didn't bring the right characters to help you destroy the weakness shields you're gonna be blowing all your MP with joker in order to deal any significant amount of damage to the enemy. Plus bosses are easily stun locked if you just spam the same attack over and over again. Which makes me wonder if it would've been good if they went the ff7R route and gave you a turn bar or something. \nif you get low at all you can just pause the game and quickly heal up. and considering how easy it is to stock up on healing items. especially if you're constantly checking Sophie's shop for those discounted healing items. you may as well just so Joker is carrying less weight. \nOh uh, you can also play as all the other phantom thieves and they all have their own movesets and theyre all fun to play.\nIts just some are more fun to play then others. Joker, Yusuke and Haru are the most fun for me Personally. Mostly because for some reason a lot of the characters either have attacks that leave you vulnerable for just a second too long. Makoto. Or characters with attacks so pathetically weak that theyre almost not worth playing. Morgana. Or characters with Gimmicks that don't feel fun. Ryuji. Yusuke has that fun counter mechanic, and i like holding down a button and watching Haru fuck stuff up. \n\nAnyhow, i've been enjoying my time with this game. I think its one of the better persona spin-offs. mostly because its not a dancing game. \n\nStory is good, \nCharacters are great,\nGameplay kinda sucks when its just you constantly going into your persona menu pressing the enemy's weakness spell and then rinsing and repeating. but when you're destroying groups of shadows its really fun. weirdly enough its the hacking sections that are the most fun. because its just you protecting futaba from trash mobs while she does her thing. \n\nyeah i'd say its worth a buy if you liked Persona 5 and need more of the characters.",

        "content": "Bought this game on PS4, Switch, and PC to support all the releases. I even gifted a switch copy to a friend, but I digress. I personally couldn't care less that it was released for Steam since I was gonna play it on PlayStation to begin with, and the Switch version is inferior in many ways. Excellent game if you played persona 5 or 5 royal, if you havent then it drops to a good game. Then again If you played 5 or 5 royal you have a ps4, and should just use that for Strikers/the dancing games if you lack a PS Vita. Apparently this game crashes in some parts according to acquaintances, but I don't plan to stick around to find out if that happens to me. Give me something else to buy, ATLUS. I could throw you some money for Nocturne",

        "content": "The short review was that it was quite good and I encourage you to buy it.\n\nLonger answer follows.\n\nCombat is snappy and fun especially as you get good at it, navigating the jails is interesting and never tedious, I find Persona really works with a more open dungeon system and non turn based combat. I would genuinely be fine with more of these going forward.\n\ncharacters were well written, old characters get more depth and new characters are great, even those with little screen time.\n\nThere are a decent variety of Personas, not as many as in the main game but that\u2019s to be expected and never feels lacking.\n\nI do have a personal gripe however, one contains spoilers for Persona 5: Royal and one does not.\n\nnon spoiler: Why is Joker\u2019s trauma never explored in this? it would make for great character depth, I know I know protag for people to put themselves onto, but what about the interrogation room? being responsible for the thieves? more? these things are traumatic and deserve to be explored\n\nSpoilers now so continue to read at your own risk \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey Atlus! So! why\u2019d you take Akechi\u2019s backstory, traumas, and aesthetic and give them to anime tony stark instead of just including Akechi!\n\nThe end of P5R shows he lives. And this shit is so...Glaring. You guys even basically gave him Akechi\u2019s sword along with everything else like how blatant can you be.\n\nReally holding out for a P5R: Scramble because it\u2019s a slightly irksome blemish.",

The characters felt so much more alive and the new characters were so loveable. Gameplay was the by far the best in the series and the jails had such fun creative designs. The soundtrack is incredible, the story felt more impactful and it got me so hooked ever since the 4th jail. The ending was beautiful and the graphics were just stunning at times. It makes me so happy to see how far persona has come and it is by far my favorite game series. This game is worth the 60 dollars completely. I wouldn't even hesitate  to play it again.  I really hope Persona continues to grow as a series and reach more people as it really is special.",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers gives us a completely new experience from the developer's past games.[/h1]\n\n48 hours and one game clear later, I [b]finally[/b] feel qualified to write a review.\nI walked into Persona 5 Strikers thinking it was [b][i]yet another musou game.[/i][/b] I have never been so wrong about a video game in my entire life.\n\n[h1][b]Omega Force[/b] changed the traditional [i]\"Clear this area, go to outpost A, defeat enemy B\" [/i]and crafted a new experience that made sure the game [i]remained[/i] a [b]Persona[/b] game before it is a [b]musou [/b]game.[/h1]\n\nThe combination of both a captivating story and involved button mashing combat (it makes sense if you think really hard about it) results in the [b][i]ENTIRE[/i][/b] Persona 5 Strikers experience.\nI honestly thought I was going to open up this game and be put in a menu-based system where I had to select my destination to move from point A to point B. I didn't expect a well-written story, or lengthy, enjoyable cutscenes, and map areas that were more than just [i]\"Go[/i][b][i] [/i][/b][i]here! Your ally is being attacked! Help x! Don't let y fall!\"[/i]\nIf you look at all of the past musou games, they are all the same copy and pasted formula. Same map layouts, different textures and models. The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

I had so much fun just hanging out with everyone in game, I also have now found my favorite character in the Persona series. Zenkichi and Sophia are treasures.

        "content": "A direct sequel to the incredible Persona 5. The main star is an awesome action combat system that is extremely faithful to the trademark Persona JRPG combat mechanics. Every single character is very different and a lot of fun to play. It's so good that I'd be happy if every Persona game going forward had it. A bunch of jamming new songs from Lyn, and returning remixed favorites as well. A lot of quality-of-life changes to fusion. The new characters are interesting, likable, and have good character arcs. It's also a much more manageable ~40 hours than the ~100+ of P5.\n\nThe story is a little fanfictiony, which is somewhat expected in Persona spin-off games. You'd better like Japanese food, because the game basically revolves around how awesome it is. The main departure from Persona 5 is the lack of a \"time economy\" (aka limited days) and the lack of social links.\n\nIt's pretty mandatory to have played Persona 5 (either version, references to Royal are basically non-existent); it will spoil large parts of the plot (if you care about that sort of thing), but more importantly, you'd have a hard time caring about the characters without the 100+ hours of context from P5.\n\n",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers feels like a full-fledged sequel to Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal. By no means is it a cheap spinoff. That said, while I'm sure the game can be enjoyed and understood without playing Persona 5/Royal, I highly recommend either watching a playthrough of Royal, emulating the base Persona 5 (making sure to buy your own copy of the game and ripping it yourself instead of other means, of course!) or if you have a PS4, playing Royal. \n\nStrikers is a 30-40 hour return with the familiar party members of Persona 5, with some new faces, and a new plot. Once again, Atlus outdid themselves in making the party feel like a tight-knit group of friends, and even gave some much needed character development to those left hanging from the original. (looking at you, Haru, Ann, and Yusuke)\n\nPersonally, the shift to a Dynasty Warriors type real-time combat system is... fine. It doesn't do anything special for me, and honestly with most boss/miniboss fights it just devolves into spamming the same couple skills until you can't anymore. That said, the translation from a turn-based JRPG to real-time action was done very well, I just personally would prefer the incredible innovations on the turn-based JRPG formula that the original games provided.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, the game is sublime. Much like Persona 5 itself, the game just bleeds style, on everything from the animations to the menu UI. The music is also just exceptional, especially since it takes some of the best tracks from Persona 5 and gives them some new, almost metal, life.\n\nI did have some issues with random crashes between loads (running an i9-9900k and a 1070ti for reference), so make sure you save often, but they maybe happened four or five times in my fourty or so hours, and would in no way detract from the shining recommendation that I can give for this game.\n\nMakoto best girl",

The amount of crashes ruin the overall experience and has cost me countless hours when I forget to save. Once they fix the crashing, it is 100% worth the money and is a fine sequel, but of course isn't on the same spectrum as the original Persona 5 or even the Royal version. If you're a big persona fan, get it but at this point I'd recommend you get this game on PS4 or even switch unless you plan to get into modding the game yourself.",

As a result first load takes a lot of time. \n2. During ~55h of gameplay game crashed 6 times. But most of the crashes (4) was in 6th jail. So better wait for patch. (According to steam beta patch already issued, and random crashes mentioned in release notes)\n3. Game has strange issues with antialiasing. But after some hours I get used to it.\n4. Only support for 16:9 screens. (no 16:10, etc)\n5. Some in game interfaces are garbage (like Sophie shop where you have to do 4 clicks to buy 1 item (multiply on number of items you want to buy))\n6. Makoto doesn't remember she was my girlfriend in P5 :(",

The gameplay is fluid, the story and characters are all fully fleshed out with good interactions and arcs through the plot. \n\nThe one gripe one can make is the crashing issues, however for me it was hardly as bad as anyone else. I only crashed when I used external software to improve the anti-aliasing. If you want, wait until patches come out or buy it elsewhere if crashes are THAT scary to you.",

        "content": "Boy howdy, these Musou Games are getting pretty sophisticated. This game starts about four months after the end of the last game and continues most of the mechanics with some caveats. The day-to-day life simulator is watered down (and made infinitely easier) by just allowing you to pop out of dungeons for a breather and quick restock without losing anything. There are a couple exceptions to this, but nothing that sets the rule.\n\nCombat is still triggered through bumping into shadow surrogates, like the last game, be it by getting the jump on them, them jumping you, or just smacking them and starting proper. Instead of teleporting to a battle dimension, enemies spawn in the world and you fight them like any other Musou. Of note, summoning your Persona or aiming your gun will cause the game to pause while you make your selections, which is nice. There are environmental objects to use to your advantage in addition to the set of skills you've come to know from the base game.\n\nThe story may be the weakest aspect of the game as it's mostly rehashing the same plot as the original game: deadly sins, rejection of cruelty, villains as dark reflections, teenagers using the power of love to kill God. You know the drill. The dialogue is characteristically ham-fisted - which I love - but can turn away the uninitiated. Also, if you were waiting for Ryuji to finally just say that F-Word, you'll get it at some point. I promise.\n\nI'm not quite at the end as of this review, but I estimate the full game takes about 50-60 hours to complete depending on how side-quest happy you tend to be.",

Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!",

        "content": "I'll start by saying that I am an avid admirer of Persona 5 and it's story. For me, it was the first of the series that I bought and played on the recommendation of a close friend. I grew to love Persona 5 so much that I had ended up playing the game over and over, committing all I could to memory. I wanted to observe every nuance of what made Persona 5 the game it was, or rather is. I even bought the Persona 5 Royal version and fell in love all over again. When I first saw Persona 5 Strikers I immediately looked into it, like any fan would. The trailer video was encaptivating, but I hesitated to buy. The completely overhauled battle system worried me. The original Persona 5 battle system encompassed a long time familiar style of RPG turn-based battles most gamers of the genre are familiar with. Additionally, the time management aspect coupled with building confidants added an endearing allure. Strikers, a now hack & slash version, redesigned combat from the ground up. Personally, I avoid games like this because I recognize my lack of ability and commitment to build the skills necessary to dominate the battlefield. The realization that I may not enjoy this game disheartened me for the longest time. Many times I skipped passed Strikers in the Steam store. However, maybe due to overwhelming boredom, I began perusing the comments of players who had played the game. I can't remember the poster, but they shared the same concern as my own. After reading it, I decided that even if I didn't love the game, that I loved the Persona franchise so much that I'd support it regardless. On that note...\n\nUSE THE GAMEPAD CONTROLS FOR THIS GAME! Standard keyboard setup is not sufficient for this game.\n\nInitially, I disliked combat, and I disliked the feeling of having my Persona 5 world condensed into the shell of an \"efficient game\". What I mean is the play style and aspects of play seemed to have been developed in a way that screams \"instant satisfaction\". Not that it's a bad thing. It just seemed hollow in comparison to its predecessor. I was starting to feel a disconnect to the series. \"I guess they're just trying to monetize on the success of the story.\" The thought spoke loudly in my head. As I started to progress into the game, it was clear that my preconceived notions were wrong.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, albeit different from Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, is still an amazing game. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts still managed to steal this skeptical heart of mine. Though I find the battle system complex and difficult to use well, it still offers a new and fun perspective. If you've played Persona 5 or Royal, this game is guaranteed to throw you for a loop. But don't give up. If you're a true Phantom Thief, you'll rise to the challenge and steal the love for this game you once had. Give it a chance. You won't regret.",

The story is pretty good for a sequel, it held my interest for the whole time and had very relaxing times in between. The gameplay is of course not a turn based rpg, but instead a hack and slash. Which might sound not as hard, but trust me its very much as hard if not harder than persona 5's gameplay. In all honesty i love persona 5 and i paid full price for this game and almost 100% completed it at 71 hours in, its worth the money.",

Need to make every attacks and dodges counts XD, utilizing the right personas also part of the strategies in order to beat even the tutorial battle (that pixie one shotted me, yikes.. reminds me of SMT nocturne's tutorial on hard difficulty)\nso this game is still fun to beat more than one playthough\n\nthe story itself is good and the environment is good too(feels like you actually visit the place, like playing YAKUZA games), but unfortunately for player who played the original P5 game, the plot is predictable and pretty similar.\n\nOld review:\nThis game is fun, but the only reason I gave dislike review is because this game CRASHED a LOT between the loading screen or some random events.\nI have to constantly save in every occasions just to make sure I can continue safely, especially on the end game when leveling our chara/personas, it was very frustating when I forgot to save and then I have to farm/do some quest again.\n\nI will change my review when they fixed this issue tho",

The tl;dr is that the gameplay is fun, there's a lot of content and there's a ton of depth in the game's fusion/Persona mechanics. But I can't recommend this game to newcomers and maybe even veterans for a simple issue; the game is horribly optimized. I'm running a 1650 and Ryzen 5 4600; not stellar components but respectable nonetheless. This game barely runs at 60 on mid/high settings at 900p. Its hilarrious just how poorly the game runs but even that isn't a dealbreaker. I wish the game ran better but I can handle a poorly optimized game as long as its stable but hoo boy is this game not stable. I'm around halfway through Strikers and I have had five separate crashes in my 20 hour playtime. Think about it, that's a crash every 4 hours. And the game doesn't have an autosave feature so you're bound to lose progress eventually. This is the ultimate reason why I cannot recommend P5S. If the game gets patches to solve the issues I've mentioned above, then yes, definitely buy this game. But for the time being, keep an eye out for a patch.",

        "content": "TL;DR: Gameplay is awesome, Story garbage, prone to crashing. SCORE: 7/10 Only recommend to fans, wait for Persona 5 for newbies.\n\nEvery review so far focuses on meme-like quotes or one thing that happens in the game. So, I'll tell you whats really in the game. The gameplay is more like Kingdom Hearts but with bigger mobs (not big mobs like Hyrule Warriors). It still retains Persona abilities and fusion but the fusion has been simplified from other entries. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and you have a fair bit of strategy to put into every fight especially the boss fights. The bosses alone will give you the sweatiest palms as they are harder than any of the Persona games by far. What I dislike about the game is its story. The Phantom Thieves are compelled to feel empathy for the antagonist of each city you go to. The writing feels very shallow even more so that in Persona 5. Also its been 20+ hrs for me and the game is still constantly holding my hand while traversing thru the maps. Like come on, don't insult my intelligence. And yes unfortunately the game is prone to crashing and it happens more often while transitioning to a new area. It becomes incredibly frustrating after you defeat an annoying boss and then the game crashes making you restart that fight. It's definitely worth $60 for returning Phantom Thieves but if this is your first Persona game I would wait until Atlus fixes the crashes and the game goes on sale for $40 or below. Also buy the Legacy BGM while you're at it, it makes the soundtrack much better!",

        "content": "Overall decent game? I was very skeptical about a musou Persona game but this turned out pretty well. \nThe core gameplay loop is great, with Persona choices, elemental weaknesses, some cool finishing moves and good ol' All Out Attacks. Narrative is not too bad, either. Just some minor issues outside of the main gameplay loop which really annoy me.\n\nIt's like the game really wants you to waste time shopping and navigating their slowly animated menus- you'd likely see some Sophie jokes in the reviews but this is really criminal in a way that is really stupidly inconvenient. \n\nAlso, the investigation phases are really not fun at all- the locations you get to go to all over Japan are really...kinda boring and feel quite token like you're \"travelling\" all over Japan- but it's really touch and go.\n\nSeveral crashes to desktop, weird camera angles and some minor UX flaws but overall the game is fine.",

Personally I do find the lack of a negotiation system to be problematic sometimes, but that's only because I get way too into the moment and sometimes don't notice when a new Persona has joined my arsenal. Would recommend for any fans of the Persona 5 series - It's a fun game with a fantastic story, and you can always get a refund if you don't like it after trying it out.",

        "content": "A great addition to the persona franchise and gives you more of the P5 team that we all love.\nYes, it's not your typical persona game especially in the gameplay aspect but that is no reason why you can't enjoy it. It really fits the game and honestly, I enjoyed it more at times than the TBS variant, especially once you get into a flow with the mechanics. The other major thing that some will harp on is the lack of the \"social sim\" aspect, it's more as a group collective this time around instead of juggling your time between school, 1 on 1s and the metaverse, you tackle things as a team from start to finish. I don't believe that to be a drawback and fits in with the more fast paced nature of Strikers.\n\nThroughly fun game and would recommend to any Persona fan. Being a sequel to P5, the game will assume you know all prior events and the team members so if you never played P5 it is not \"friendly\" in that respect to totally new players. You can totally have fun with it but a lot will not make sense to you story or even character wise.",

The combat felt rewarding and wasn't just mindless button mashing, the music was top notch, and it was heartwarming to watch cast grow even more than how they did in vanilla P5. Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions and I really hope we get to see them again in the future assuming that this isn't the end. Now the story did feel rushed at times, but it was still a memorable experience overall that ended perfectly. I highly recommend this game to any Persona fan who's not yet ready to say goodbye to the Phantom Thieves just yet.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an enjoyable game, but doesn't quite stand up to the high bar set by P5 (and even higher bar set by P5R). The animations for All Out Attacks aren't quite as flashy, the game doesn't have as much meat to it, there are a lot of quality of life features missing, and much fewer voice clips for common actions like buying, selling, or aiming a gun (meaning that you're going to hear the exact same line spoken over and over and over again). However, saying that Strikers isn't as good as P5 or Royal is like saying an uncut diamond isn't as good as a 24-karat gold ring; in either case, what you have is still pretty damn good. \n\nIf you've never played P5 before, don't be mistaken into thinking you can just leap into this game. It picks up after the events of the previous game and does very little to backtrack over who characters are or what events happened, which is great for returning fans since they can just right back into the action, but newcomers will be left totally lost. There is probably still an enjoyable story here for newbies, but he finer points will be lost--and considering just how important story is to the Persona series--it is a large thing to miss out on. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever return to this game now that I've beaten it. I honestly prefer the turn-based RPG battles of normal P5, and Royal is just filled with so much better content and quality-of-life features that I've grown so accustomed to that, should I ever feel the urge to jump back into Persona, I think I'll be popping in Royal long before Strikers. \n\nAll that said, however, this was still a damn fun game and I'm glad I played it. I feel like it's even worth full asking price if you're really a fan. If not, than there's no shame waiting for a sale, too. I think the enjoyment this game provides for Persona fans far surpasses any of it's minor gripes.",

        "content": "As someone with 400+ hours in the original Persona 5 game, I can say without a doubt that this is a worthy spin-off. The game not being turn-based did scare me a bit and yes, it is very difficult in the first 5 or so hours but after a while I got used to it and when you learn to mix combos and weaknesses it gets really fun to play (the teammates are also super fun to use; Yusuke, Haru and Wolf especially), Jails (basically dimestore Palaces) are very creative and beautiful to look at, the boss fights are incredible and I honestly liked the boss fights in Strikers more than than original P5. The fanservice was done very well, and the music is fantastic as usual (Axe to Grind and What You Wish For blows Last Surprise and Take Over out of the water). The new characters - Sophia and Zenkichi are both phenomenal additions with sick Persona designs and I found both of them to be complex and riveting (and also in the case of Sophia, the most adorable character of All Time). Also runs very well except for 2 crashes. \n\nI do have some gripes but they're mostly minor. The biggest complaint is that it's not entirely stable - I've crashed twice in the game for no reason. Bond points are tedious and if you want to max everything you have to get to bond level 99 which is asinine. The lock-on system is truly horrendous as well.\n\nWhile it may be questionable whether it's worth 60 dollars, it is overall a fantastic spin-off which proves that while Atlus might milk the franchise, they're at least putting effort into it. I recommend this game especially if you loved P4G and P5/P5R. \n\nAnd of course, I, like everyone else, look forward to the inevitable Persona 3 and Persona 5 Royal PC port.",

        "content": "First off, I highly recommend this game if you loved Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal.  It is a great spin-off that actually adds something to the characters' stories from the last game.  I will say that if you have not played the previous Persona 5, then I do not recommend this to be your first game in the series.  The game really does assume that you know what happened previously and only does a bit of background knowledge.\n\nAnother caveat, this game is NOT turn-based like the other Persona games.  Now, while I prefer turn-based combat, this games combat is extremely fun.  It is not just random button mashing, but instead a bit more strategy needs to be put into each fight no matter the difficulty.  I played the whole game on hard and I will say that at the start it will kick your ass if you have no experience playing musou games.  However, once you start to understand the combat, the personas, each character, and the skills then the game becomes a lot more easier (still not easy, but you will have better knowledge into the combat).\n\nStory-wise, this game is extremely strong much like Persona 5/Royal.  Is it as good a story?  No, but then again the length of the game is like one half that of the normal games.  I will not write any spoilers, but I did enjoy the story with each character still being the same, but growing a bit.  It is such a good feeling to see the Phantom Thieves interacting with one another, in both the happy scenes and the more serious ones too.  The addition of some new characters was something that I was worried about, but I think they handled it remarkably well.  They both have interesting backgrounds, interactions, and actually important to the story.  \n\nJust one last mention, the music is fantastic again.  It sounds just like Persona 5 which I loved back when I played it and I still love it now.\n\nIssues I had with the game.  I see that people have struggled with crashes and I will say that I only crashed once and thankfully I had saved like a minute prior.  But, I do think that each person's game will act differently so make sure to save as much as possible!  The other issue I had with this game is just the lack of side stuff to do with the Phantom Thieves like what was possible in the previous versions.  I did not expect nearly as much as the last games, but I think there could have been more interesting \"requests\" with the members.\n\nI highly recommend this game!",

        "content": "I genuinely don't like the [b] original [/b] Persona 5. The characters and story all felt extremely bland to me, with its supposed themes being executed with the bare minimum of effort placed into it. Most characters were bland and some were even annoying. Including the wasted potential of the ideas the game presented, in the end it just left me unsatisfied. The only saving grace of the original game to me was the gameplay, the style, and a few tracks of the ost.\n\nThis game however [b] is not [/b] the original Persona 5 and it really shows, not just with its gameplay, but with its genuine thought and care placed into its characters and plot with only one minor hiccup being the obvious twist. Besides that this game blows the original P5 out of the park with everything it has to offer.\nThe game's new characters Zenkichi and Sophia are some of the best persona characters I've ever gotten to experience, Sophia specifically now being my all time favorite with her fun personality and amazing growth as a person, or in her case an AI. Learning about emotions as the story progresses and learning what it means to have a heart. Zenkichi isn't too far behind her though, being the first adult of the Phantom Thieves does bring in some fun banter between him and them all, usually with him being called \"Gramps\" and teased for being a bit of a dork. Him being part of the police as well adds some more chemistry with the Thieves bringing in a pretty fun dynamic between them reminding them they can't go and break the law for their shenanigans. Both of them make for amazing additions to an already set in stone team.\nThe themes presented with its villains really struck a cord with me this time around actually making me feel some emotion on my part. A majority of them even relate with some of the main characters own lives which makes for really interesting lines of dialogue where they reflect on it and how it must've affected the villains' thoughts.\nThe gameplay is absolutely outstanding with it's fast based combat, being similar to a warriors game of course it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but I really did enjoy it. Every characters moveset felt unique, fun, and extremely flashy. All of which just makes the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nThere are negatives of course, this game may be close to a perfect 10 but there are a few glaring issues with the game.\nCrashes and soft locks aren't a common occurrence but they really shouldn't be happening in the first place considering how it never happens on consoles, I may have been able to get used to it but some people won't.\nThe way fusions work in this game feel incredibly tedious requiring incredibly low level personas to be at levels like 40 and 50 to create the fusion, which later on is a lot easier but in the beginning is absolutely annoying.\n\nBesides those issues however I really think this is the best Persona game in the series. Definitely not a jump on point for newcomers, but I really recommend it if you're already into persona and wanting a fun action game. It certainly made this P4 die hard quite happy.",

        "content": "Does anyone else think that persona helped cure their autism?\n\nI played persona 5 and I'm pretty much the main character but in real life, so I decided to try out things he did to make friends and get girlfriends. I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

        "content": "An enjoyable sequel to Persona 5. However, if you have not played Persona 5 beforehand, you'll feel a bit behind when the characters make references to things that haven't happened in this game before. If you want to know the full story but don't/can't play Persona 5, I would recommend watching Persona 5 The Animation as it will give you most of the character development needed to understand the relationship between our heroes. The only warning I should offer is that it does crash from time to time. I noticed it really only happened when I used a wireless controller, but once I switched to a wired connection I didn't notice any issues. Save frequently just in case that's not the reason. And although it is a jump from turn-based combat to an active combat system, the game is still extremely enjoyable.",

It is a true sequel to Persona 5 (not royal, basegame P5) as it keeps the superb character writing of the original while not falling to the general \"Persona spinoff character archetypes\".\nThe gameplay might be drastically different to the usual turn-based combat that the series is known for, but they've managed to make a great sequel that has such a different feeling.\nI will say though, the final few chapters of the story fall back on basically repeating story arcs from P5 but with minor twists. The game is aware of this somewhat, and it does come up as a joke that this is incredibly similar to what the thieves has already experienced.\n\nIf you like Persona 5 in any way, I would strongly recommend this game, just remember to save often as the game tends to crash on me randomly",

Of course, the music stays BUMPIN with an awesome remix to some of the iconic ones from P5 while adding some new bops to fit better with this style of Persona. Without spoiling anything, the story seems to gloss over or ignore some previous pivotal moments from P5 Royal but still stays canon regardless. Absolute must-buy for anyone who played Persona 5!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers has been in my opinion, one of the best spin offs of the persona series yet. Lets begin this by saying that while you can play this without ever having played persona 5 or persona 5 royal, the game expects you have and all character development is saved for the new comers, Sophia and Zenkichi. With that out of the way, lets start with the pros to the game.\n\nThe graphics, while not as impressive as the original game, still have the p5 charm to it and the overall art style has seen great improvements in my opinion.\n\nThe new tracks like Counterstrike and Axe to Grind as well as the remixes of Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert make the OST of this game a win in my book, with a overall feeling of high energy in each track.\n\nThe gameplay (once you get used to the controls) is extremely fun, with persona elements such as weaknesses and all out attacks incorporated nicely into the new format. Since this is what you're going to be spending the entire game doing, it does good work to not get stale.\n\nThe story is basically p5's story but with the villains being much more fleshed out and relatable. It also does have a few elements that make it fresh but for the most part it's a lot of the same.\n\nThe voice work and dialogue is surprisingly good and had a few solid chuckles, with Zenkichi, Ryuji, Futaba and Sophia taking the spotlight throughout the game.\n\nNow that that's done, some somewhat nit picky negatives.\n\nPlaying on a keyboard is not advised as the controls are somewhat awkward and require some switching around to make work.\n\nOptions for 4k resolution are simply not here for those who have such moniters.\n\nI found that the game can be rather buggy at times. I had multiple instances where buttons would just stop working, such as my attack button or the enter and escape keys. This would require me to halt all progress so i could restart my game in order to fix it. The game also crashed twice on me.\n\nFinally, your characters don't level up with at the same rate as they do p5, meaning that your main party could be level 60 while the characters you haven't used at all could be level 44. This isn't a major problem until the final boss where a certain feature requires you use all your party members. And if you haven't leveled up all your members equally, then it's time to hit the grind stone for a few hours so can actually stand a chance.\n\nOverall, these negatives didn't do much in the way of harming the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed strikers and recommend to anyone who's a fan of the persona series. It's well worth the money and a good way to kill 35+ hours.",

The game doesn't leave you bored due to Its time mechanics and the requests you get, another great feature is the ability to revisit jails and replay boss fights. I'm a big fan of the post-game world since you don't have to repeat the entire game again to reach the grinding point, but of course if you wanna replay the game you can complete the new requests and start a New Game+ . Overall I really recommend this game if you're a fan of Persona 5 or the Persona series",

        "content": "I was positively surprised with the complexity of combat system - every mechanic present in Persona 5 is here, from All-out-Attacks, Baton Passes to Showtime Attacks, with some new additions. Seriously, combat is *really* good. Personas fusions and customizations are also very good, even if there are fewer Personas than in the mainline games.\n\nUnfortunately, the other main part of Persona gameplay loop, the time management, is non-existent here. While a shame, it's understandable based on the premise of the game; P5S shows a much more compact story than mainline Persona games, and there's little place for in-depth systems from the original, such as Confidants and such.\n\nAs for the quality of the PC port... crashes and weird antialiasing aside, trying to set up a working keyboard and mouse controls almost gave me an aneurysm. KB+M default controls seem to be made by a person who never touched a PC. All in all, it didn't diminish my experience by much, just made the first two hours of so more frustrating then they need to be.\n\nAll in all, I was afraid this game would be a cheap cashgrab, feeding on the love people have for Persona 5. But it's not, there's a lot of actual quality here; you just need to remember it's a action spin-off, not full Persona experience.",

It's damn good.\n\nThis is not a dynasty warriors - style offshoot, a la the fire emblem or zelda warriors games; this is a true, blue sequel.\n\nStory wise, it kinda rehashes the themes of the third semester in P5R, but that's not a bad thing. Some things are better touched on, and some things are less approached. It's a different look at the ideas. In addition, there's a lot of something both P5 and P5R were lacking: team building. The crew hangs out a lot. I mean, A LOT. there's good elaboration of character dynamics, a lot of humor, and it leaves you feeling warm inside the way well written characters do.\n\nThe new characters are well written and enjoyable (much more so than Kasumi, in my opinion). They find their place fairly quickly and latch on to you the way the others did in their own time.\n\nGameplay wise, it's dynasty warriors with some twists. A lot of components of traditional persona combat are integrated, but moved to a reaction based real time style- think of it as the changes from Dragon Age: Origins to DA2, but better. (in my opinion, much better). Strengths, weaknesses, technicals, baton passes and showtimes- they're here.\n\nThe soundtrack is, as expected of the persona franchise, fulla bangers. Look foreword to it.\n\nI was glad to hang out with these weird kids in japan again, and I was not disappointed.",

        "content": "They did great work on this game. It reflects off of Persona 5 and they still keep the Persona 3 vibe, style, and music like its other games. \n\nIf you are a big fan of Shin Megami Tensei, and the older Persona series, you will like this.\n\nAlthough the game's style is much different, and inspired by the types of fighting style games like\nHyrule Warriors Age of Calamity, and Dynasty Warriors.\n\nIts a mobby hack and slash game, so if you want a ton of action this is a much get. Its not a turn based\nRPG like the other titles but you still kick some ass.\n\nWhats great is that instead of just trying to remember a ton of moves, they have them shown\ndown at the bottom of the window of your game to show you what to press if you dont remember how to do\nsome moves. You can also look at the tutorials again in the Options Menu in case you missed something.\nInstead of mashing at the keys, its good to get to know your moves. If you dont you may lose much faster especially\nif you run into a mid boss or something nasty.\n\nIts got a ton of Story, good Music, it has its suspense moments, and comedy too. It has that Anime/Manga feel of it as well.\n\nIm not a reviewer snob (like yelpers) but just leaving an honest review, and its gameplay.\n\nI think the only thing i would complain about is that they dont leave an option to watch the cutscenes\nyou just completed. So if you want to see them again, you dont get to.\n\nI have the bonus content they dont provide any of the animations, only the behind the scenes of the production.\n\nOther than that its still a solid, and clean game. I havent ran into any bugs yet. \n\nThe game is flashy, its colorful, its not plain, and the Ui looks pretty good.\n\nWorth every penny. Buy it!! BUY IT NOW!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STILL HERE OwO!\n",

        "content": "I definitely enjoyed this game, but I do have a few bones to pick. Overall? I love it, and definitely recommend it. But I also can't imagine enjoying it anywhere near as much if I hadn't played the prequel.\n\nLoved:\n\n- The travelling by camper van premise. And you can still decorate inside - Nice touch.\n\n- Yusuke. No lie, he's my favourite character. So weird, and usually the one to make me crack a smile or laugh.\n\n- Graphic style. Easy on the eyes!\n\n- Characters, in general. You definitely get a good dose of each of their personalities in the game, which is great.\n\n- Game mechanics. I'm fine with turn-based games, as Persona has been until now, but real time is definitely so much more fun. You can use also use objects in the environment to pull off different moves. Not novel or anything, but definitely makes the battles more dynamic. \n\n- The voice acting. I usually listen to the original voices over the English voices because the latter often bothers me. But here? The voice actors nailed it. Lots of emotion, tone, and personality. That said, I suggest changing the audio configuration ASAP in game, as I find of the base levels of background volume to voice volume to be imbalanced, and sometimes I could not hear the voices over the background music.\n\n- Music was great, as always (okinawa jail bgm is one of my favourites in the game). The upbeat and catchy songs were also very fitting. Having some of the music and songs from P5 was a nice touch/connection, as well.\n\nBones to pick:\n\n- Game length. I did everything possible in about 43 hours in my first run, and I took my time. It's action and content packed with not too many extras, but I had expected there to be a good 20 more hours (including extras) considering its predecessors. I ended up cursing the whole \"only 1 month of summer vacation\" standard of Japan as the reason why the game had to be \"short\".\n\n- Linear/simple story. Doesn't usually bother me, but having played other persona games, it's simple by comparison.\n\n- Personas. So many were cut out in this game - and Persona 5 already had a bunch cut from Persona 4...I had been looking forward to discovering them, seeing how they'd be animated and going to town with them, but there are definitely far fewer.\n\n- Less sneaking around. Ambushing enemies from behind sofas, tables, corners etc in P5 had been fun. In this game it's mostly ambushing from above in some form - nice add-on, but I don't think it should have replaced the other ambush methods. I had also anticipated ambushing from actual shadows/blind spots, which happens in P5, but there wasn't really any of that in this game. It also bothered me that you could perch on some things but not others - e.g. traffic poles (Shibuya arc), but not the concrete lanterns/posts, or even low rooftops (Kyoto arc)? Couldn't see the logic behind that. Also a little disappointed that you couldn't ambush from trees. I guess because of the \"phantom dash\" distance you could leap to various perches, it seems the potential for the context was too limiting.\n\n- I do miss the one on one, sometimes one on two, bonding scenarios from P5. You get a handful of bonding chances in Strikers, but not many. Instead it focuses on group bonding, which shows how tight the Phantom Thieves group is. \n\nPetty disappointments:\n\n- Protagonist has virtually no role this game. Kinda just there to watch his friends be the ones to help/inspire others this time. Would have been nice if each character had their own arc, in addition to the group dynamic, like P5 did.\n\n- Protagonist wears his glasses all game. I was hoping I could take them off...As far as what's been suggested he doesn't even need them, anyway!",

I thought it would be like the other Dynasty Warriors games (Hyrule Warriors for example) but boy am I wrong do I love the gameplay. It really blends in classic Persona elements with action fighting mechanics from Dynasty Warriors and it works really well that you can have a lot of fun with the gameplay and use it to your advantage during boss fights and all. \n\nNow if only Atlus releases Persona 5 Royal on Steam I would be a happy man. But this game is still worth buying for sure!",

It's a great playing action RPG that incorporates key elements from the Persona 5 gameplay loop (dungeon crawling/elemental based combat system) elegantly into an Omega Force game. It's Persona 5-2 alright. If you enjoy those characters, there's plenty of content for you to enjoy here.",

        "content": "I just beat the game a couple days ago and my only complaint really is that it seemed like it was a little too short.  That and the crashing problem but hopefully they can update it and fix that.  The game crashed for me about 10 times but luckily I didn't lose too much data.  Other than these two things, I really love this game!!  It is so much fun to play.  Just walking around and enjoying the scenery and the music is fun.  The fighting is also fun.  I'm still working on doing the extra stuff so I'm not completely finished yet but I have to say that I think this game is so awesome.  I was looking forward to playing it for the past couple of months and it did not disappoint in the least.  I did play Persona 5 a while ago so I know everyone well and it's really cool that they made this so that we can see them again.  Everyone is just as cool as they were before and there are a couple new characters who are also very cool.  The voice actors are all very good (I use the Japanese).  The graphics are also very good.  It's very shiny and bright.  Overall, I will give this game an A+++++.  I will keep at it until I get everything and then I'll probably start over.  I think it's nice that they give you the option to select your difficulty level.  Next time I play, I will try hard mode.  I don't suppose there is any chance of them making another sequel but I can dream.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Persona games.  I am a die hard Persona fan and this game rocks!!  It's Showtime.",

        "content": "Alright, so you can enter into this game with no knowledge of the P5(royal not needed) and be fine, you can understand and like this story, it just improves it if you do know.\n\nGame play, first ever muso(idk the spelling of the game) I've played that I feel challenged in from something other than more hp. You actually have to use your brain while playing. Also although not a turnbased game like mainline persona games, it translates the persona turn based elements very well in gun and skills.\n\nStory, so far characters have been great, entire cast is back, with 2 new main characters who are both interesting. Charters feel exactly as they should be and story is intriguing, and it's neat how with the jails it seems each jail owner didn't make it through desire, but trauma, so it makes the villans more interesting.\n\nAlso it's basically P52, which is funny because in one of the trailers a 2 almost appeared after the \"5\" and then \"S\" butted it out. It is a sequel.\n\nVisuals, Looks like a persona 5 game, but not only that the jail aspects are really polished, not only does each jail seem unique, the quality of the details is amazing. Other muso games seem to not care all that much, but this one just random buildings may have defined shops and markets or be their own specific thing. It's not just slightly different colors. Nor is it copy and paste. Though this does come at a cost. It's not one big map but many decent size areas per jail with load times. I'm on a gaming laptop and can run it at around 1.5 resolution, max graphical settings, 60 frames non combat(btw max cap is 60, so wait till someone mods it for that to change) which lowers to 40 in hectic combat(which I never actually notice, unless i'm looking at my fps number). I say all this is because between each area it's about 10-20 seconds. Which isn't short enough to ignore nor long enough to alt tab. This is my biggest complaint with the game and that's saying a lot. \n\nAll i can say is compared to muso games this is probably the best(although i've heard hyrule warriors was made by the same studio so maybe that's just as good) in every department.\n\nI would recommend buying this game at full price even if not a persona fan. \n\nNot a giant downside to me but the social life aspect is toned down a lot. P5R was I'd say 25 percent social life, 60 percent game, and 15 percent cutscene, this is 65 percent game, 25 percent cutscene, and 10 percent social life",

The new battle system was addicting and it worked very well and I loved having the whole Persona 5 cast from the start. The concept of taking a road trip across Japan in classy 50's Style RV was just Icing on the Cake! Overall I enjoyed the game I just wish there were social links and the areas you Visited were bigger and you could go inside buildings and explore, which I hope they do for Persona 6. Well Done Atlus please bring Persona 3 FES to steam too and give it the same treatment as P4 Golden. And make sure we can control are party members!",

        "content": "In stark contrast to the slow burn of epic-length cutscenes that greet you in previous Persona games, Persona 5 starts its long journey with a bang by throwing you directly into a fast-paced foot chase through a vibrant, stylized Tokyo casino. That\u2019s a bold move, and it\u2019s emblematic of the entire experience. As we\u2019re introduced to the complex yet approachable turn-based battle system in those opening moments, series fans will recognize not only returning systems from Persona 3 and 4, but also long-absent elements like ranged weapons and negotiation that haven\u2019t been in a Persona game in over a decade, adding more depth and variety to combat. Persona 5 is the culmination of everything the JRPG series has been building to, with familiar elements dialed up to 11 and some welcome new surprises added into the mix.\nIn what\u2019s by far the series\u2019 strongest story to date, Persona 5 puts you in the capable shoes of a high school student who spends his evenings saving the world. By day, you\u2019ll attend class, answer quiz questions, and live the life of a typical teenager, but after school you'll see the clever concept of invading the minds of corrupt adults who are up to no good and battling psychological demons in order to change their hearts.\nShare.\n\nThese stand-out dungeons take place in \u201cpalaces\u201d created within the mind of each target, and Atlus takes advantage of this to set them in diverse and outlandish places. Unlike the procedurally generated halls of Persona 3\u2019s Tartarus or Persona 4\u2019s Midnight Channel, Persona 5\u2019s labyrinths are fully hand-built and feature unique puzzles and mechanics that vary with the theme of each dungeon and never repeat. A museum, for example, has very different security measures than a Medieval castle, and you\u2019ll find very different enemies in a pyramid than you might in a spaceship. Assembling pieces of secret codes to solve a bank vault\u2019s cryptogram or positioning tiles to interpret hieroglyphics feel almost like entirely different games. This gives each palace a sense of identity tied to the target and provides some smart, unpredictable story moments and challenges.\nPersona 5\u2019s sense of scope is staggering compared to Persona 3 or 4.\n This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet.",

        "content": "Worthy of being called a sequel, the Musou style combat was a refreshing change of pace while still keeping familiar elements from persona games. Really enjoyed the story, characters and new music. Hoping Atlus does more experiments like this in the future, I think the series could do well with it. Definitely play Persona 5/The Royal before starting this, as you will be completely lost on key plot points if you haven't. Other than some crashing issues, this version is fantastic and I'm excited to see the rest of the Persona franchise make its way to PC.\n\nWould die for Sophia and Zenkichi, 11/10",

What's worse is that after you force quit the application, you can't even start the game up without a black screen to change the game back to windowed. If someone has a fix for this, please help. Otherwise I definitely cannot recommend this game at all on PC\n\nEDIT: I finally got it working after I uninstalled it, and deleted all my P5S files from %appdata%.\nIf it weren't for the issues listed above, this game is definitely fun to play if you enjoy any of the musou games. Its kind of a mix between something like Kingdom Hearts and the Warrior series. However, based on the fact that I cannot play this game in fullscreen and many crashes in between gameplay, I still cannot recommend it YET. Until they fix it these core issues, I would 100% recommend this game to those who want to sit back, relax and play a hack n slash Persona game",

The story was pretty good but felt a bit restrictive with what the player can do on their daily life, something older fans may dislike but isn't that big of an issue. \n\nGraphics are alright although it did have some optimal issues (game crashing whenever leaving the Metaverse or frames dropping drastically out of nowhere).\n\nCharacters are solid still including the newer ones that were introduced for this game. Their backstory really show how and why they ended up like how they were in the game and it really showed how much resolution they have achieved by the end. \n\nControls on the other hand were very complicated in my opinion (on keyboard) so a controller is highly recommended as it makes the game way easier (and it solves the massive frame drop issue if you disconnect it and reconnect it).\n\nStory was alright, the way it introduced the villain's backstories really makes you feel for them and want them to change for the better. The story could be better in my opinion but given the circumstances (in game time restrictions) \n\noverall, again, a nice hack and slash anyone can play. Although I believe that the experience is way better when you have played Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal. Still a game anyone can pick up and give a try and be welcomed to the series",

Story is good, though a good part will be lost if you haven't played Persona 5, which you should anyway (if you don't own a PS3 or PS4, it works flawlessly on RPCS3 (PS3 emulator) as long as you have a good CPU). The only bad thing about it is there isn't more of it (it's still 40-60 hours, and it's all great). There's also no New Game+, though I wouldn't be surprised if it's patched in later as you can save your clear data.\n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best new games I've played in the last 5 years if not longer. If you've played Persona 5, you'll probably love it, and if you haven't, then what the hell are you waiting for?",

        "content": "A fun muso game with a familiar cast and world with the same staples Persona 5 is known for such as it's great sound track and its style is also faithful. Combat is enjoyable and the way combos expand the more you play as each character is a good way to get you playing everyone and seeing each thief's arsenal while in combat. I really liked seeing the existing cast interact more in what felt like a more natural way. With new cast members thrown into the mix, it only strengthens the character line up within Persona 5's world. Certain characters however do end up boiling down to their singular trope such as Futaba being more egregious or Makoto doubling down on her motherly role within the group. \n\nOverall story was interesting enough to keep me wanted to see how it would progress. However, there were a few moments that felt repetitive in the game play when it came down to locations. Some areas feel copy/paste of one another which is a bit of a let down considering what potential could have been met.\n\nThe main negative however that I'd consider the real reason behind whether this game is worth getting on Steam is that it crashes. Not just once or twice but multiple times. Personally, it crashed 15+ times but some friends have had it crash much more or much less. It is not a great port over onto PC and with these issues being so irregular, be prepared to what you could end up dealing with.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an amazing game. \n\nActing as a sequel to, and taking place during the summer after the events of Persona 5, you get to reunite with the members of the Phantom Thieves to travel across Japan, traversing \"Jails\" in order to save humanity. Unlike the turn-based combat style of the original Persona 5, Strikers has combat similar to the 1 vs many style of the Dynasty Warriors games, with fluid transitions between combat and traversing the Jails.\nThe game has a great story that builds upon the world of the original game, and I definitely welcomed new characters like Zenkichi and Sofia, but I would suggest not playing this game until you play Persona 5 first, because this game is a sequel and spends no time introducing people. \n\nLike other Persona games, the soundtrack is phenomenal and a joy to listen to. \n\nHowever, in regards to the PC version, I have had issues with the game crashing several times (only during loading screens), so remember to save often.\n\n*Note: I would not advise completing all achievements for this game, mainly because you will need to max out all BOND Skills, which took me over 10 hours exclusively grinding one boss over and over again just to get enough EXP to complete the achievement.",

I keep hearing some of the \"best Persona 5 writing\" is here and whilst there are some good lines/scenes, imo it's a step down in every aspect compared to P5/Royal. \n\nStrikers is just a road trip with the old gang and real time combat, where very little is mentioned about their past/recent history and Haru's forgotten she's your girl. Definitely think this was developed to be as friendly to newcomers as possible. \n\nStill a good game though, 7.5/10...........Now bring the proper Persona 5 to PC Atlus!",

        "content": "Ok so at first I gave this a negative review due to issues with the game. I still stand by that review for the release version of the game. But recently, Atlus has released a hot-fix that seemingly fixed my main problem with Persona 5 Strikers. I can now play in fullscreen. So far I would say I enjoy the game. Again I wouldn't recommend immediately buying an Atlus PC port due to their history with day 1 bugs but I'm glad to see they have fixed it.",

I am fans of dynasty warrior game since on playstation 2, and this battle system with my favorite persona character is really awesome. especially every persona move has different specials!

Normal mode does give you those code vein boss vibes since you have to be careful on the attack, but here the boss have really high HP so all you need is timing and reading move pattern. \n\nHope this kind of combat will continue to Persona 6.\n\nTLDR : 10/10 will recommend to everyone who likes musou game. and a must have for persona lover.",

During my 20 hour gameplay through, it crashed about 8 times (on a above spec pc), and each time losing much progress in game because there is no auto-save.",

        "content": "(Written at Ver. 1.0.0, please verify accuracy on future versions.)\nTO SUMMARIZE:\nI really like this game as a sequel to Persona 5. Standalone, the most glaring thing is you're dropped straight in assuming you already understand Persona 5's plot. While I feel like you would enjoy the game regardless, I highly recommend visiting the first Persona 5 game. If you're in a pinch, watch a playthough or in the worst case scenario the anime (though not very well received.)\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI have had numerous crashes since the early release day and to my knowledge there is no fix yet, which is a little off-putting. If you do decide to get this game for PC, please practice good saving habits if only for this reason. Save as often as possible, as this game does *not* autosave. While I still enjoyed the experience overall, the crash issue made me wish I got it for console instead. There are also a few game-breaking bugs which you will have to avoid. For example, you cannot play in fullscreen or borderless windowed modes or the game will go into a black screen if you trigger a cutscene. You must play in windowed mode as far as  my experience has shown me.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay combines aspects of Persona 5's JRPG elements and combat, with musou mechanics you're probably familiar with most \"Warriors\" games. While it has its flaws, I never found myself bored. Fights felt interesting, though sometimes downright easy playing on \"Normal.\"\n\nAs a note to Atlus, you've got to be more timely with bug-fixes and more courteous to your PC audience if you want to keep going with this PC release approach. At the very least keep some sort of communication with the player base acknowledging the issues.\n\nSTORY:\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of the original Persona 5. It does not take into consideration your past romance(s?) or confidants, nor can I say it makes any clear reference to the events of Persona 5 Royal. You may notice some themes being reused in the first few levels of the game that are similar to Persona 5's palace themes. I will say, however, that they are distinct enough to not feel like a rehash. The antagonists feel unique, and contrast heavily from the precursor of this game. \n\nOverall, without giving anything away, while the writing is definitely not as good as before it's pleasant for those already familiar with the first game, showing strong character growth in contrast and an interesting new evil to take on. I personally believe this is a worthy sequel story-wise.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nI'm hoping the glitches are resolved for the PC release at some point. That said, I can comfortably recommend this game to people who are itching for more of the Phantom Thieves adventures, those looking to beat up massive hordes of shadows, or even if you're really weird and want to get introduced to Persona 5 with this game! I'm giving the game a thumbs up, but begrudgingly so in light of the current state of the PC release. But for my purposes, this game was worth the occasional crash and being forced to play in Windowed mode.",

The ONLY downside this game has is that you'll most likely be spending upwards of 10 hours on one achievement if you decide to go for 100%. That's a problem that less than 1% of people will even have, but it's still something to keep in mind.",

I would of preferred the combat system in the other Personas.  Each time I start playing it after about 20 minutes or less I already want to put the game down and be done with it since the combat just ruins it for me. It's like a Dynasty Warriors game and those types of games just aren't my thing. \nOne of the few things I really did like about this game is the ability to swap characters and walk around in the dungeons with them, among a few other small things.\n\nOverall I would rate this a 5/10 \nAverage,",

Nah, It's just a very good game ^^",

        "content": "TLDR: Finished Persona 5?  Get this.  Never played Persona 5?  Probably not for you.\n\nIf you've played Persona 5 and are on the fence about this because of it being Dynasty Warriors combat, take the plunge.\n\nThe combat is actually way more Persona than I expected.  In fact, for difficult fights I spent way more time hitting the Persona button, exploiting weaknesses, switching characters to heal/buff, etc.  In any event, as someone who usually really doesn't care for DW, I found the combat in the game pretty enjoyable.  The dungeons were at least as interesting as anything P5 was doing, too.\n\nUnlike typical DW games, the draw here is the story.  This one is a direct story sequel to the Persona 5.  If you liked that story and want to just hang out with the dudes again on a road trip around Japan doing Phantom Thieves stuff, then play this game.  You don't get the time management social game from the mainline Persona games, but you get a full-fledged, consistent with Persona 5, sort of on-rails story.  It's really solid.\n\nOne other thing that I didn't really expect, the general presentation of the game is also pretty consistent with the quality of Persona 5.  The wild animations, menus, punk rock aesthetic, the music, voice acting... it's all here and it's very much a continuation of what P5 had going on.\n\nAll that said, with how much time and energy is spent on a story that assumes you played Persona 5, even if you really dig the combat for it's own sake, this is only really for people who have played and finished P5.  The story here is good, but it does not at all stand on its own 2 feet.  Tons of references to the events of P5 and definitely an assumption that you're already familiar with the cast.",

        "content": "So right off the bat the game is great, solid 8 or 9 out of 10, and if you think you'll like it, or even if you're on the fence, I'd recommend picking it up at some point. \nIt is quite rare for me to purchase a game at full price after a release, but I want this release to do incredibly well so that atlus, and by extension sony, will see the profit and bring games like persona 5 royal(please), God of War, Bloodborne, etc more quickly to pc. This being said I won't be softening any criticisms below whats here is a genuine face value of the game.\n\nAnimation, story, and interaction\n-This game is purely more persona 5 with it's character interactions. Given there is no confidant system or romance options, so waifu wars don't work here, but if you enjoyed the casual phantom thief bits from persona 5 this is a treat.\n-The music is purely high quality stuff, mostly all of the new tracks written for this game sound great. From the first prison's music to the final bosses it's all persona standards, and even if you aren't a fan of it, the game allows any persona music to be the main soundtrack.\n-Most of the animations are pretty well done, primarily the new showtime special attacks are beautifully done, each character has their own unique animation matching their personality. Honestly Joker has the most basic sadly because of his many persona options.\n\nThe Gameplay    \n Perspective of a playthrough on hard first time using a ps4 controller via an xbox controller layout\n\nFrankly I love the combat style of this game, it advertises itself as being a hack in slash, which by technicality is true. Coming from a hard difficulty perspective, I entirely believe that hard is the best way for this game to be experienced. \nBasic attacks and combos --- Basic attacking is unique to each character however they all share similarities. Combos are all simple at face value being either   X-Y    X-X-Y     or   X-X-X-Y                 but they can get depth from stringing them together, but what makes the combo system unique is how each of those inputs will cast a persona skill, whether it be a buff, debuff, or skill. These combos likewise use no precious sp, so in longer fights they are instrumental so that joker doesn't develop magic dysfunction as the boss pulls out a second health bar. \n\nMore advanced unique movesets ---  each character has specially made attack animations and mechanics and I will attempt to list them here without any spoilers. Some overlap but that's to be expected\nJoker- has a basic dagger gun moveset based around getting quick persona combos\nRyuji- focuses on charged hits that deal incredible damage, and can prevent staggering with a self buff\nAnn- Can imbue her whip with fire that allows her to deal with an enemies weakness from basic attacks\nMorgana- simple normal moveset, becomes car for special moveset. nuff said\nYusuke- Is based around unique combo counts, where Y activates a parry frame, and if successful he can add more hits to a combo counter\nHaru- Purely aoe strength, her persona combo strikes are large and lingering and all of her hits are powerful\nMakota-buffs her large combo attacks with nuclear, uses johana to ride down enemies with X-X-X-Y\nFutaba has the same role to the point of redundancy. The largest change is the added support where she increases showtime gauges\n\nCounterstrikes\nNot only is this my favorite track in the game against japanese ironman lol, but it is a skill in the new bond system that I quite like. This skill means any last minute dodges allow the character to immediately retaliate with a persona attack. Get this skill immediately it is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThief dash aka area hopscotch \n-dash to a piece of scenery and interact with it dealing damage of a certain type. Honestly I really like this system, I like the little differences in character the interactions show, and it gives the player more control over the terrain. All bosses use the interaction really neatly as well with the least creative being the final boss who I won't spoil\n\nOkay now time for the nitpicks\nThe slightly bad \n\nSpammed with tutorials at the beginning - LIKE DEAR GOD the first few hours of the game you won't escape these things. It's like they were stalking me waiting to pop out from a corner EXCUSE ME SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT BURN. Like they serve a purpose but if you already know how the status works from persona 5 you will get annoyed fast. Doesn't help that they give you messages about EVERY character when you switch to them, which playing all of them from the beginning, it gets irritating fast.\n\nThe game always has you fighting with 3 other ai controlled phantom thieves unless you take them off of your party, and I would discourage doing this. Usually the ai are protected from their own stupidity by generous I frames and resistance to attacks, and they seem to avoid using sp..........Unless they are healing\n               \nHOWEVER, some times the ai just get in your way, they will die like idiots and leave you fighting alone, just because the game didn't save them. Like for instance, and I'll avoid spoilers, but one boss creates stupid walls of lasers to hit you, and these things move incredibly slowly. I'd have to drop my controller on the floor to get hit by these things, but the ai will not avoid them. They don't understand that the back of the platform is the only safe spot so they stand there and get whacked. It's honestly infuriating.\n\n-So this is a genuine problem but a strange one. So this game lacks all interaction with side characters who weren't phantom thieves, so there is no takemi or iwai in this game which is already pretty sad. Instead their shops are combined into a shop Sophie runs from wherever the thieves are at that moment. Now breaking the disbelief that sitting in the middle of an island a delivery could get there in a matter of moments, this shop seems like a good way to get the thieves items from anywhere. The problem lies in the amount you can buy, as the amount is always from 1-4 of an item, including healing(I think the most is a 120 heal later in the game which you can get 4 of at a time). Throughout the game this isn't an issue, it works well in fact to stop you from skyrim healing through every fight, BUT AT THE END, there is a gauntlet of tough refights with bosses as well as dangerous shadows for the postgame content. This practically requires decent health resources as well as sp items, but the only way to restock this dumb shop is by spending time in the metaverse, but not just that winning fights. That means you have to run through an area killing everything several times over to get the heath resources needed to beat some of this tough fights. The shop also contains incredibly rare cooking items, specifically that POS coffee bean that is never there but is needed for 2 post game special recipes, so get to grinding that last area. I swear if the enemies in that last area weren't pushovers to a grenade launcher I would have lost my sanity\n\n-This game has no Satanael. None of the awakened personas from persona 5 are here, every single member of the main cast has their originals, Morgana still has gorro, Ryuji still has captain kid, Ann has Carmen, Haru, has M'lady etc. It's pretty mentally annoying especially since Morgana HAD to become max rank as a confidant, and thus had to have an evolved persona.\n\nOkay THE REALLY BAD\n-The game has a bug where it softlocks after a particular boss...... This did not affect me but it is worth noting\n-There can be infinite loading screens........This did not affect me\n-The game doesn't start for some people\n- And finally the most annoying one, this thing crashes randomly in loading screens, and it's painful and this one did affect me. I had to live in fear half the time because I had made significant progress, and a visit to Lavenzia could outright delete that time spent. It was frankly awful and has not been patched as of this review.",

        "content": "Great music as always, with classic remixes and top tier new tracks. Story is a little better than expected out of a spinoff game, though the fact there are no mentions of Royal content whatsoever is disappointing. The core gameplay is actually really fun and not as much of a deviation from traditional combat as you'd think, and it really highlights how cool the Phantom Thieves are meant to look when moving and fighting simultaneously as a team. The Personas available feel very limiting (especially the late game ones) but fusion is relatively in depth and fun to play with. The \"real life\" exploration is also constricted but the different settings the game takes place in are charming and nice to have to make the game feel more like a mainline title.\n\nMy only major complaint is the crashing, which is a complete pain in the ass in a game without autosave. Save often! Other than that, there are only a few small annoying issues, such as shop items having incredibly low stock, money being a major bottleneck even after 80 hours + full completion, way too many BOND skills, and Persona stat changes feeling useless.\nOverall, P5S is a fun game that Persona 5 fans will almost certainly have fun with.",

        "content": "Initial Thoughts/The Story: Firstly, let me say this game is absolutely incredible! It's a fantastic follow up to vanilla Persona 5. And if you haven't had the chance to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then you can pretty much jump into this game semi-blind, there are a few things spoiled but nothing too major I'd say. I didn't think this game would be all that great when it was first announced but after playing it and beating it today, I can say it's a lot better than I anticipated. Especially as this is technically a spin-off. I can confidently say that this game is the best possible sequel to Persona 5 we could receive. Atlus and Koei Tecmo really out did themselves.\n\nThe combat/gameplay: Gone is the Confidant/Social Link system from previous main Persona games and in their stead comes a story progressed system. The game does not overload you with confidants and stats to raise (which in my opinion is a great thing!) as the game progresses with the story and doesn't move on until you're ready, so you can spend what would be considered two separate days in Persona 5 just grinding in the jails as Persona 5 Strikers will not move on until the next day until you're ready and have finished what you want for that day. Next are the Bond Skills. These essentially replace confidant abilities and offer so much variety in gameplay. You can invest your points into skills that: increase your health and sp (something I seriously recommend for later on in the game), allow you to crack open safes that contain decent loot, increase your physical and magical attacks, allow your allies to heal you from alignments, and more! These bond points are a welcomed feature in my eyes! Now for the big thing: the new combat system. I must say, I haven't played a warriors-styled game until now but I am pleasantly surprised with the results. Gone is the JRPG turn-based combat system. You now have to partake in essentially horde/wave battles, something I think fits the Persona series quite well. You get to wreak loads of havoc, unleashing powerful and swift attacks onto oncoming hoards of mindless shadows. I especially love how time freezes when you're using your personas, it gives you plenty of time to plan out your attacks and make sure you utilise the best skills possible. I really like the new combat system and honestly believe the Persona series should utilise this going forward. Showtime attacks are also a feature (I think I may prefer the Royal showtime attacks however), they don't do much damage initially to bosses later in the game, however there is a bond skill that increases the amount of damage that showtime attacks does (something I seriously recommend you invest your points in).\n\nNew Characters: I know for a fact I'm not the only one who wishes this game followed Royal's timeline rather than vanilla's, but the absence of Akechi and Sumire are made up for with the two new party members of this game: Sophia and Zenkichi. I can say without a doubt, these two characters are great additions, they're so comedic and powerful additions to the Phantom Thieves. If I'm being honest, I prefer how these two characters were handled and implemented into the story rather than how Atlus dropped the ball with Sumire in Royal. They flow really well into the story and their eventual arcs are intriguing all the way. Not to mention they provide a unique sense of freshness for the already established cast. All the characters work well off each other and you can tell they've grown even closer during Joker's six month absence. Sophia is a more cutesy addition whereas Zenkichi is the more comedic addition. As I have previously mentioned, both new characters are fantastic additions to the PT cast and I hope to see them return in an eventual Persona 5 Arena game or even another P5 related spin-off.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, no game is absolutely perfect, this game does have some striking (no pun intended) issues. The game crashed for me around three times in total, mainly during the end of the second jail, specifically when I had finished the trauma cell (so just be careful about that as you may experience this issue for yourself and lose some progress). Next is an issue where some of the keys decided to stop functioning. There is a simple fix for this issue: simply just press the windows key and go out the game and go right back in. Even though this was easy to fix, it was still a hindrance, especially as it happened during the final boss! Although this isn't an issue that has affected me, some people are reporting that some of the characters voice's differ in audio quality, I personally couldn't tell the difference and thought the audio sounded perfect for everyone. I do understand some people may be able to tell considering the voice lines were recorded at the actor's homes using a kit provided to them. But like I said, I couldn't tell the difference so it doesn't effect me.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Finally, I bought the digital deluxe edition of this game so I could play it early, and my playtime ended in a whopping 60:04 hours. It took me a little longer than maybe some other players as I decided to really focus on the side requests/activities. I fought many bosses multiple times to grind for money and xp (I recommend the Seth fight if you want to farm an easy 10k xp) and just really focused on the requests (something I never expected I'd do). I also spent a lot of my time going for most of the achievements, some are locked behind Post-Game and NG+. I managed to get most achievements I wanted and they were actually fun to get, none of them were too annoying and required a lot of patience to get. So I'm sure trophy hunters will be pleased to here this. The story is phenomenal and really is Persona 5 2, I cannot recommend this game enough to existing Persona fans and newcomers to the series, if you want to experience something P5 related but can't get any of the main games, GET THIS ONE! It's such a joy to play thought, the characters, the world, the gameplay, and especially the music! Lyn and Lotus Juice once again knock it out of the park with the amazing songs that are in this game. I am leaving this game with some of my favourite Persona songs: songs such as Daredevil and Counterstrike are just phenomenal. If you haven't heard them yet I suggest looking them up on Youtube. I love, love, love, love this game's OST and think it's one of the best in the series (mainline and spin-offs included). If you're debating on purchasing this game, then as I die-hard Persona fan, I say go for it. Take the leap and just play this game. It's a wonderful experience. And whilst it may not be as long and as intricate as vanilla P5/Royal, it's still a fantastic experience even though it's half as long as vanilla P5. Definitely pick this game up. And I hope many more Persona games make their way to Steam so newcomers have more games to try to further push themselves into this fantastic series.\n\nScore: Pretty much expected if you've read all of my review so far but I'm going to give Persona 5 Strikers a perfect 10/10 (despite the cons I have previously listed). Please try this game if you ever get the chance it's an experience you do NOT want to miss. Thank you for reading my review and thank you to Atlus and Koei Tecmo for creating such a brilliant sequel to Persona 5.\n\n \n",

        "content": "I genuinely really like this game. It's significantly better than other Warriors styled games I've played in the past (though BOTW: Age of Calamity was just as good as this game, I'd say) and it manages to retain Persona 5's style really well despite being so different gameplay-wise. Once you get the hang of it, the battle mechanics of this game feel really fluid and satisfying to pull off, and while these types of games are known for being spammy, I think with the amount of variety between each playable character and the varied settings you encounter, the game does a really good job with not becoming stale. I think that the character interactions are fun and that the plot progression was more well developed than I was expecting out of a Warriors-type spin off. It really felt like I was playing Persona 5 and the only thing that was different was how I hit things.\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game (a reason I'm gladly willing to change my recommendation for if fixed in the future) is because it crashes and softlocks itself far often. I've made an obsessive habit of saving after literally every small action I take because every time this game has to load something in, there's an unnecessarily high possibility of it crashing. At the time of this review, I have about 35 hours in this game (end of the 5th jail) and I was having a really good time with it, until I reached a point after a boss fight where loading in from the metaverse softlocks the game. I know it hasn't crashed because the game still responds if the controller is disconnected, but I'm otherwise met with a black screen I cannot hope to progress from. From the research I did into this issue, it seems my computer isn't the only one softlocking at that exact point in the game.\nI implore Atlus/ Koei-Tecmo to patch the game so that the PC port is actually functional, because I think it's a real shame they let this great game be released while this broken.",

This game contains everything ranging from hack and slash elements to Ryuji finally saying F*ck instead for the first time in history. sadly though your date from persona 5 wont remember ever dating you it personally broke my heart </3. But anyways this game is a master piece i recommend it \u221e/10. \n\nAfter diving into the game for 60 hours i encountered a bug in the fifth jail boss(i wont say the name because its a spoiler) that makes the screen go black while its loading the next scene. to prevent this from happening , you need to alt tab out for 20 second then alt tab in. do it for like 4 or 5 times while the red whooshy things that appear while you are teleporting back to the real world. this should skip the loading screen and let u move on to the next scene.",

        "content": "Despite having some criticism of the game, overall I'm having a lot of fun playing it.\n\nGoing into the game I heard it was a cross between Dynasty Warriors and Persona. Playing it feels like neither.\n\nCombat itself is similar to Dynasty Warriors but lacks the feeling of big epic battles. Instead of large scale battles you have fixed encounters as if you were exploring a palace in persona 5. The combat is supposed to be fast paced but a lot of the time you end up opening menus to cast spells or switch your persona.\n\nA lot of what you'd expect in a Persona game is here but parts of it feel empty and missing. You have most the systems you'd except like fusing and elemental weakness and resistances however there are no social links. In fact there's not much socializing at all in this game.\n\nThere's a bond meter with the Phantom Thieves as you play through the game and clear side quests but that's about it. If you were hoping to see a large cast of returning characters it's a bit disappointing. All the Phantom Thieves are here and I did get to go for ramen with Ryuji but personally I always found the non-playable characters more interesting.\n\nOverall the game feels very Persona lite, hits a lot of what I want but is unsatisfying in some ways. If you're looking for Persona 5-2 this is not that game. If you just want to hang out with the Phantom Thieves again this game scratches that itch.",

Only wish Denuvo anti-cheat wasn't a thing for this port cos it makes you fear for your life with each step you take. Can crash randomly, especially in loading screens and make you lose the progress.

(Recommended in general but not on steam. No idea if beasts of a PC would be better. I have a 1070 and probably didn't help that I was streaming it)\n\nOverall so far, I'm liking that time isn't restricted in this game. It goes by progression. Stamina (pretty much the SP) can drain pretty quick so going to checkpoints or the entrance of the metaverse will help a lot. Leave, shop if you need to, go back, all healed up. Music is great and gameplay seems alright depending on the characters you use with their different attack combos. Seeing \"show time\" and all out attacks in real time is a pretty neat thing to look at too.",

I really hope Atlus continues on this path for the Persona series. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy turn based as much as any fan of that combat system, but having free range of movement while also being able to still obtain new persona's, summon current persona's, has been a great way to enjoy combat scenarios. \n\nLike any JRPG there is some repetitiveness, but I don't mind that, and I honestly don't think any fan of JRPG's should, as this is something we've done for however many years we've (fans of JRPG's) been fans of this genre. I'm enjoying the story, and I've basically put every game on the shelf until I complete this. \n\nI won't go into depth detail, because frankly, I'm not great at that. What I can do is give you my recommendation for this game tho. I am not disappointed with my purchase, and I can't wait to see how it ends. So happy to have the Phantom Thieves back with a new game.\n\n-Phantom Thief Shinya",

        "content": "The real time combat took me a bit to get used to but this is, in every way that matters, a full on sequel to Persona 5.  It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves in a manner perhaps even more stylish than the original game.  You get to bond with each of your team mates, engage in various side quests, go on excursions, fight to soul-stirring music (at 60FPS), and take on a threat to the world as you go on a road trip around Japan.  What's not to like?  Unfortunately, as of this writing (in early March 2021), the game is plagued by persistent crashing on my system accompanied by occasional random slowdowns.  I save every change I get so I won't lose progress.  Hopefully they'll get these kinks worked out because I love this game.",

        "content": "Picks up right where Persona 5 left off, which as a returning player from the original Persona 5 feels great. The game will probably make less sense for people who aren't familiar with the original Persona 5, but the gameplay is still solid regardless. \n\nThere are a lot of QoL changes made in Strikers that just weren't there in the original Persona 5, some to accommodate the new Dynasty-Warriors type combat, while others are just generally nice changes (such as no punishment for returning to the real world from the Metaverse). \n\nOverall if you've played the original Persona 5 and don't mind the switchup in the core combat loop, I highly recommend this game. If you haven't played the original Persona 5, you can still enjoy this game for what it's worth but you may miss out on references made to the original game.",

If you wanna see your favorite gymnast waifu, and edgey the hedgey detective friend I'm sorry to disappoint. She doesn't exist, and he's still dead the end. Also, there's no social aspect to the game no stats, no confidants, nough problem? \nNow speed round\nStory good, but ending is...similar to persona 5's end.\nCombat is good, but easily broken with 99 luck and mudo/hama with a mudo/hama boost. At least for mobs.\nNo romance... HOW DARE YOU!!!\nCharacter well Ryuji must have joined the navy because he's cursin like a sailor otherwise new characters are fine, and old characters are consistent.\nGame overall? Well i think it's a  fun concept that needs more polish. I would enjoy seeing another game like this more in line with the classic confidant system, some better \"levels/dungeons\", and be a little more polished combat wise.\nShould you buy this game? Yes, if you're fine with royal not being a thing, turn based combat being booted, and no confidant/social/romance system. It is a genuine good time, and i would recommend it.",

Baton passes, 1 more attacks and all out attacks are all still there, even fusing new personas and collecting them from combat.\n\nOverall if you enjoyed Persona 5 and/or Persona 5 Royal (this is a sequel to just base 5 though i believe), its well worth a buy if you don't like musou style games maybe wait till it goes on sale and give it a try, I'm having a blast so far.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the game where you get to cruise around Japan with all of the homies from the vanilla Persona 5. In some ways, it's like Final Fantasy 15 but less brokey and more combat.\n\nThis game is incredibly similar to the original game when it comes to story structure. Unfortunately, this one manages to be even more predictable, but I still liked the story, even though it had some low-low moments. ( that bath scene was sad )\n\nUnfortunately, if you haven't played the original persona 5 or the royal version of it, you will not understand why these characters are important. In addition, you will, of course, receive spoilers for the original game.\n\nThe combat is fun, but you won't find DMC 5 levels of depth to it. That's fine, but the problem lies with the fact that, the combat becomes boring halfway through.\nMeaning that if the game was shorter it would fit better or if the game had more to its combat it would fit the length of the game better.\n\nThis PC port comes with a few problems that we've had since day one, the best example being the very first load screen.\nWhatever the reason, it takes a very long time to load in and sometimes it never happens.\n\n\nThis game is fine, but wait for a sale, also I highly recommend you stay away from it if you never played the original game.",

        "content": "This game is not a spin-off , this is a direct sequel to the original Persona 5.A really good sequel at that.\nThe story and characters are better than vanilla Persona 5 story (not as good as Royal) in my opinion.\nThe gameplay surprisingly fits well more than traditional turn-based combat.People say this is like Warriors combat and although that is true , this feels more like a fast-paced Final Fantasy 7 Remake's combat than traditional Warriors game.\nSoundtracks are great , combat is fun , bosses require strategy and understanding of the system , characters are fun and the story is really gripping.\nBut I would not recommend this game to people who haven't play vanilla Persona 5.Since this is a sequel , a lot of the references will be lost to you and you won't be invested in the story and characters as much as those who have played the vanilla.",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers is a good game[/h1]\n[h1]But wait for a sale[/h1]\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n- All original voices are back (at least in English).\n- New characters are good and feel natural to the P5 world.\n- Persona collecting somehow still works despite the change in the combat mechanics.\n- New locations and dungeons look great.\n- Story doesn't completely suck despite it being a spinoff game.\n- Zenkichi is best girl\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Strikers a lot. The characters talking with each other felt as natural as it did in 5/Royal. Having the gang travel Japan was also a good decision, as it meant not being stuck in Tokyo the entire time (which they could've very easily done if they wanted).\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n-From a story standpoint, Royal is never mentioned. At all. Also, all non-party confidants (except three) never appear in the game.\n-Game reminds you of romances, but doesn't actually care what you chose.\n-Game doesn't do a good job of encouraging you to switch up party members, but still forces some party members in some select fights.\n-Game isn't difficult (especially if you find the right item/bond build that allows you to mow over anything in the game).\n-Lack of combo depth.\n-Music is mostly P5 ost remixes with some new stuff (and overall, not as good as the original).\n-Where is Igor?\n-Play with a controller.\n-Story doesn't understand it's own universe's rules.\n\nTo expand upon the last point, there are two times the game contradicts their own rules. First, in the first dungeon, it's shown that, besides the party, people enter the Jails as their shadows. However, the game breaks this rule several times, and doesn't explain why.\nThe second major gaffe: Morgana mentions at the very end of the game that its the \"surprise of receiving a calling card\" that causes Desires to manifest, similar to Treasures. This is just a flat wrong explanation of how the calling cards work from both P5/Royal, as well as from the same game.\n\nAs to the other points, the combat is basic and easy, and there are ways to break it (hint: Two things break shields. weaknesses and criticals) which makes combat a joke. I used Yusuke the entire game and wasn't really punished for it, which shouldn't be ok in a game that emphasized elemental affinities.\n\nIf you can get over these somewhat minor gripes, the game is fun. I would only recommend it if it gets a price cut or sale though.",

        "content": "After a whole playthrough of the game, I can say that I really enjoyed P5S. There were some flaws, of course, but for the most part, it was nice to see the Phantom Thieves back in action.\n\nHere's some Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n-Remixed music, including new tracks with vocals by Lyn Inaizumi\n-Dual Audio (It's there if you want it. I'll stick with muh English)\n-Familiar stylish UI\n-Personas' properties (weaknesses/strengths/etc) are the same\n-The game is a sequel and makes references to P5 Vanilla (Royal's 3rd Semester was not canon)\n-The \"musou\" combat is delegated to a per-encounter basis. Ambush/Get detected by a wandering shadow, then more shadows pop out in a closed off area. Defeat, then move on.\n-Stealth in a musou game. Who'd a thunk it?\n-This game is Persona first, Musou second.\n\nSome things to note:\n-Game has a tendency to crash on loading screens (possibly due to DRM)\n-Due to it being a sequel, it will contain some spoilers for P5\n-Since P5R was not canon, Kasumi is not playable\n-Story can also seem a bit underwhelming compared to 5, and not as long\n-The DLC Personas of 5 are, of course, missing (they were DLC, of course)\n-No social links [Replaced by Bond System. This gives you access to an array of perks, kind of like talents]\n-Must beat game first to unlock Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal battle themes (\"Last Surprise\"/\"Take Over\"), unlike the methods for Switch/PS4\n-The system for jumping to pillars, chandeliers, etc is a bit awkward and can catch you mid-combo\n-If the English voice track feels blemished or sounds off, the VAs recorded out of studio during the pandemic. It sounded fine to me with headphones on.\n\nThat said, most of the Cons are mild gripes. Except the crashing, but I blame that more on the DRM than I do the game.\n\nBut if you really want to see what the Thieves are like in action combat (which was pretty fitting for the cast), give it a try.",

        "content": "I would say an 8.5/10. Great game, but I've had my own wave of emotions playing it.\n\nIn my opinion, the game plays almost nothing like a normal musuo game. This is *very* Persona feeling, it's just not turned based. Taking advantage of elemental weakness is still EXTREMELY important (like every persona game) and I find myself rarely combo-ing normal enemies and only using it during bosses. Once you have SP items available the combat feels more like Persona 5 completely. Combo-ing becomes near useless.\n\nMy thoughts on the story and dungeon designs, I think the first half of the game is considerably better than the end half. There's some depth that is skipped for the last half of the game that makes me feel like things were rushed, or it felt like they had to piece things together in the middle, like they knew what they wanted but needed something there. Especially the final area, it felt SUPER short if you compared it to the first or second. It surprised me how fast I got to the final boss.\n\nI don't know what people mean, I've only ever crashed once while playing the entire game. If you're crashing that often I honestly think your computer just can't handle the game? The game is well optimized in my opinion. The only other issue I had was my controller while playing registered A B and X all as the same input. I had to assign my controller on steam and that fixed it.",

I cannot tell you where to get the denuvoless .exe however but after applying the exe, it brings the exe size down from 331,000kb to only 38,000kb and might fix some technical issues for you.\n\nall in all, fun game.",

Only problem is the lack of personas - all the iconic endgame ones from the previous entries are noticeably missing. \n\nIf you haven't played a persona game before, don't jump into this as your first one. Trust me. Start with P4G, and by the time you beat that, P5R should have made it's way to pc(Sega has basically already said it will happen).

P5S prioritised the combat, rather then the social aspects of the game and broke the tradition of Persona by giving it an Hack n Slash styled combat system - and it worked well. It feels different in a good way but it still feels like Persona 5 with weapons and personas, fusions, items etc.\n\nThe story was just as good as Persona 5 and it was the perfect addition to the Persona 5 storyline.\n\nTo whether your an Persona 5 fan, or just starting the series, the game is for you but I highly recommend you play Persona 5 first anyway to understand the lore about the cognition, characters, etc.",

        "content": "One word of caution: this game has crashed at least once for me, and the game does not autosave. Use every opportunity to save \u2014 save at every checkpoint, and save every time you have free time.\n\nOther than that, this game is fantastic. I've only [i]watched[/i] a playthrough of Persona 5 since I never owned a PS4 so I can't speak for how the game feels compared to P5, but I'm enjoying the hell out of this one. It might be a spin-off or a side story, but it's a good one. Instead of the usual Persona-style combat, battles are replaced with fast paced, small-scale Dynasty Warrior fights, and the battle music has been remixed to match. For everything else: the characters, the music, the style, the writing; it's all there. \n\nWell, almost. It's still a spin-off. There's no social links for example; during the free time segments, all you really do is walk around, shop for items and maybe talk to some party members for some basic dialogue, but nothing like in the main Persona games. That said, it's still an amazing game in its own right, as long as you don't expect a [i]true[/i] sequel.\n\nOf course, if you've never played or otherwise experienced Persona 5, this game will feel alienating as you're missing huge parts of the story and the characters. Here's hoping the success of this game will prompt a proper PC version of Persona 5 Royal so more people can enjoy this.",

I was concerned at first that it was going to be more musou than Persona (as in, mostly focused on the combat rather than the story), but thankfully those concerns were immediately alleviated upon booting up the game. I'm not a huge musou fan, and I don't think I've ever unlocked New Game+ in a game that required you to do a bunch of extra stuff before, but I loved this game so much that I did every single quest and every single thing to unlock New Game+. The story really draws you in, and seeing all of the characters I love so much again made me so incredibly happy. I absolutely cried during the ending credits. \n\nThe only issue I have with this game is the crashing -- I noticed it always happens for me on loading screens, and it can be extremely frustrating. Make sure you save as often as possible. Other than that, I have zero complaints. I love all of the new characters, the story, the music, the locations, the aesthetics, the cutscenes, everything. In fact, I love it so much that I started a new game immediately after completing everything in my first run! If you love Persona 5, this sequel is absolutely worth it. If you don't like musous, you can play on easy mode so you can just experience the story!\n\nNow PLEASE bring Persona 5 Royal to Steam, Atlus!!!",

So unless there's a legitimate optimization patch, which the hotfix didn't seem to help here, I suggest you go for the Switch or PS4 version instead.",

Running the game as admin, disabling fullscreen optimization, running in Windowed mode, setting the game to run in Ultra low-latency mode in the Nvidia Control panel, reverting all of the settings to \"application controlled\" in the Nvidia control panel, and uninstalling all of the DLC.\n\nThe soundtrack coming in a separate application (not MP3s I can actually load on my phone) was already a bummer, beating the 5th dungeon's boss 6 times in a row to try and get past a glitch with the game is just inexcusable. \n\n- I did get past the issue by using a separate computer. Keep an eye out for any patches that may have resolved this issue but if you don't want to fight to get the game to run properly I'd still hold out.",

For those who have not played baseline Persona 5 I would heavily recommend you do so before playing this game. P5S feels great to be back into the world of Persona alone let alone the refreshing combat that gives it a new feel and twist. The characters are the same lovable idiots we grew with through P5 and seeing them again is awesome, added with a few new people and its a fantastic dynamic. If you have played any other persona game you know the music is great and the way they personas work in this new combat feels natural. \n\nPS: Hard mode is really hard at the start and well worth the challenge if your like me and hate yourself\n\nEdit: 45 hours and I finished the game, 9.5/10 I bought it for 75$ and id happily spend that again",

And if you have the extra music pack, that just ADDS more to it. \n\nThe combat is fastpaced, and the difficulty of each encounter just becomes more fun.  (Despite... some issues)\n\nThe story in this game matches Persona 5's, as this spinoff follows the aftermath of P5S. \n\n| The Bad\n\nThe scaling of HP of basic trash mobs seems... excessively high. And that's just basically it. \n\nI am NOT a fan of how many skills that stop you from moving. Specifically, it feels like Bufu/Zio, and the certain debuffs that stun you, need to be nerfed in effectiveness. Also, FUCK YOUR COUCH, Sleep. \n\nAnd the biggest elephant in the room?\nThe crashing. \n\nYeah, no. This game has a powerful crashing fetish. \nAnd the stutters become evident in the game...\n\n\n|The Rating\n\nWhile the game has it's flaws, the characters are charming, the combat is exciting, and in general the game feels difficult without being cheap. \n\nMy rating is Four Stolen Desires out of five.",

I unfortunately started with Persona 4 Golden for the PS vita (wish I played this franchise earlier) which then got me to P5 for the PS4 and now P5S for the PC. I feel pretty fancy getting to play different persona games on different platforms.\n\nOverall, if you like persona or JRPGs in general.. This is a must buy. However be warned, I do recommend playing P5 or P5R before diving into Strikers. It is an exact sequal to where P5 left off and rarely is a sequal that does benefit from playing the previous title. As P5 or P5R will introduce you to each character traditionally which makes the inside jokes and connection to each character that much more meaningful.",

With the story, voice acting, cut-scenes and more, it feels closer to a Persona 5 sequel than a standard Mousou game, especially compared to most of the Warriors' crossovers.  The combat is engaging and carries a lot of the Persona feeling considering the fast-paced action style.  Very happy with it; very occasional random crashes can get really irritating (especially on Merciless now) but it's the only bug I've experienced, and is otherwise a solid game.

        "content": "Another PC port from ATLUS! It's always great to see!\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a really unique spin on the Persona series. It takes the awesome world and characters of Persona 5 and mashes it with a real time combat system similar to the Hyrule Warriors series. I came into this game thinking I would be spamming my primary attack button to win, but was pleasantly surprised that it is far more diverse and dynamic than that. The way they crossed the Persona fusion system with all the Persona abilities with the Warriors battle system works so well and makes it way more engaging.\n\nWhile I have not completed the entire story yet, what I have seen so far makes me feel like I never stopped playing Persona 5. The characters' stories and the voice acting is still the same greatness from Persona 5 and it really almost feels like a true sequel to the game. Definitely would recommend to anyone who has played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\nMy only gripe with this game.. is the PC Port. Unfortunately, Koei Tecmo was involved in the development of this game, meaning the PC Port is definitely gonna have some issues. For one, the game is capped to 60 FPS, which is an improvement compared to Persona 5 Royal's 30 fps, it is definitely disappointing there isn't a way to uncap the frame rate like in ATLUS's port of Persona 4 Golden. The anti-aliasing is also very lazy and makes the in-game menus look very blurry, and the character models will also look very aliasied unless you turn the Resolution Scale up to 2.0 (in my experience). The game still runs great, but the port itself still feels pretty lazy and feels like they didn't even try to adjust it for the PC like they did with Persona 4 Golden.",

        "content": "After eight hours of play I experienced my first crash. This reset *roughly* twenty minutes of dialogue / cutscenes but I figured this was a good time to detail my first impressions.\n\nEverything from here on can contain a spoiler, read the TL;DR if you want.\n\nIf you have experience with FF: XIII or Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home. The majority of the combat is face-paced, hack'n'slash gameplay that feels enjoyably intense. While not up to Devil May Cry levels of complexity, the fights are very fun. Team member selection is vital to not getting teamwiped, even at the early levels, typical for an Atlus game.\n\nI think this game was designed for a controller in mind, if you have one: play with it. Otherwise, I highly recommend rebinding almost every default combat / interaction key in the game. While initially frustrating, like most games on PC, a good keybinding setup is the first skill in any game. \n\nIf you're new to the genre or Atlus games, don't be afraid to play on easy. I don't claim to be an expert to these type of games but, as a very competitive individual, I did get sent back to the loading screen more than once before completing the first dungeon on normal. Don't expect to be a god at this game if you have limited to no experience w/ the combat of other Atlus games. As is usual of this brand: the skill ceiling is high, the floor is rock bottom. And, trust me, the game is trying to make you experience rock bottom.\n\nAs for sound, top notch. The music has caused me, more than once, to sit back in my chair and take my hands of the controls. Some tracks are nostalgic from P5; others completely new. Each it's own an experience worth noting. The voice acting is solid. It really helps engross you in the story that would, otherwise, be boring to read.\n\nGraphics are what I expected: anime. The cutscenes are well done w/ a mix of 2D and 3D animation. I want to make a note: I am not a fan of 3D modeling / animation BUT it's done well. The combat feels fun and looks great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting engrossing\nGraphics: 9/10 - I don't have a problem w/ 60fps and graphics that come straight from PS4. Feels Persona 5, man.\nGameplay: 9/10 - High learning curve. Can be very punishing but rewards good strategy. Initial keybindings are T R A S H.\n\nI experienced my first game crash an hour before writing this review. This game has bugs.\nRegardless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic, fast-paced hack'n'slash games.\n\nEdit: 34 hours and still playing. Suffered another crash that reset me the final 1/3 of a dungeon. Another 30 minute setback; nothing major. Frustrating, but both of my game crashes occurred after extended sessions (6+ hours). Rereading my initial impressions: all of them still have merit. My gut tells me I'm entering the final stages of the story. I'll give my final thoughts when I finish.",

The game seems unfinished for steam and not worth your money, Get it on a console and hopefully it'll actually be a finished game\n\nEDIT: after putting in 30 hours the review still stands. The game has randomly closed by itself, and I have still had to alt tab to get keys to work",

I like the way they blended Persona gameplay elements with Dynasty Warriors gameplay, it works really well so you can't just spam attack or just personas. They also encourage you to take your time and try out every party member and not use just Joker as there is no deadlines either.\n\nI 100%ed the game and it took me about 44 hours to do so and I didn't rush through the game either so I'd say that's a good amount if you wanted more Persona 5 content.\n\n",

        "content": "I am making an edit to my review because I said I wanted a mainline title with this game-play. While this game is fun, there are a few caveats:\n\n* No matter what character you use, combat gets somewhat repetitive after a while. \n\n* This game is surprisingly long (at least, in my opinion).\n\n* If you want more enjoyment out of the story, you need to have played any version of Persona 5 first.\n\nHowever, this game has plenty of positives to warrant buying:\n\n* Awesome soundtrack.\n\n* Graphics are fantastic.\n\n* Fantastic boss designs.\n\n* RPG elements present (sort of like Final Fantasy 7 Remake).\n\n* And many more to discover for yourself!\n\n\nTLDR: A good game with shortcomings.",

        "content": "As a fan of Persona 4 and 5, i cannot recommend this. Yes, it is more of a Persona game than just a musou slasher, it has lovable characters, some sort of a plot and the same world we all love.\n\nBut.\nThe game has a clunky combat system (And I MEAN IT, i cannot enjoy the combat after Honkai Impact, a mobile game), mediocre camera, always-tight-and-cramped combat areas, non-intiuitive dodge system that cannot guarantee a dodge, unlikeable healing system. DMG-sponge minibosses that WILL hit you back because dodge is broken.\n\nWhat's happening on the screen looks like a mess. A magnitude of monsters on the screen, flashes and damage numbers everywhere... you cannot enjoy your characters or cool combat moves because you basically see anything. \n\nI do not like the way they handled \"no time limit\" design while trying to squeeze it into the old idea of having a calendar. Basically, you can visit the dungeon as many times in a row as you like. And you do not need to visit the shops or town activities because this time you buy stuff \"online\" and there's no social progression save for a generic \"bond level\" for the whole group that gives you skill points. So, my problem with the whole thing is it's ruining the world, your impression and your affection for the game. During the time you are playing through a dungeon, you leave it to replenish HP\\SP, you appear in the Cafe with the old man Sakura standing and looking at you, then you immediately go back, manage your inventory via a menu, go to a dungeon, fight, leave, replenish, go to a dungeon, back to cafe.... all in the same day. Completely ruins the Persona mood for me.\n\nAnd all the game is feeling like it's repetative and trying to waste your time. Yeah, you get \"palaces\" again, but this time with more of a free-roam. You get your main objective at point A but it's locked and you have to visit locations B,C,D to get some shining orb and fight a miniboss. But guess what, at objective D you need to unlock the last door by ... guess what? Pulling levers E,F,G in location D.\n\nAt this point i got bored. If you like this kind of games - give it a shot.",

        "content": "This game isn't just some Dynasty Warriors reskin, it's not a Persona cashgrab, Persona 5 Strikers is a fully fledged sequel to the original Persona 5 with more than enough content to be thought of as a true persona game. After 100+ Hours in this game I can happily say this is another fantastic game by Atlus (and KT this time).\n\n[h1] MINIMAL STORY SPOILERS AHEAD[/h1]\n\n[b] Overview[/b]\nThe Phantom Thieves are back and they are prepared to journey across Japan. Strikers' world building feels great, even whist travelling from Tokyo to Sendai, Sapporo, Okinawa, Kyoto, Fu.kuoka and Osaka in the space of 1 month and exploring jails as they go. Each city looks fantastic and are all very lively, an improvement on Persona 5. Though the combat may look a little intimidating to long time Persona fans it feels more at home with the actual combat the Phantom Thieves would go through. The beginning, middle and end of the game is consistently great and Atlus & KT gave a masterpiece such as Persona 5 a sequel it deserved.\n\n[b] Gameplay[/b]\nThis time around the Phantom Thieves are tasked at exploring Jails across Japan, city-sized palaces ruled by some of the most powerful people in Japan. To fit the combat of Strikers, Jails are much larger than Palaces found in Persona 5 but are still filled with small details the can really grab your eye. A lot of enjoyment can be gained from just running around these Jails and mopping up shadows just for fun. \nAs I mentioned before the combat is rather different than your traditional SMT or Persona game, but the most pivotal mechanics are still used in Strikers. Every Phantom Thief has their original personas and skills but all have a unique playstyle for you to experience and decide on your 'main'. Joker still has his wildcard ability, but due to the lack of Igor in the velvet room he only has access to half the personas available in Persona 5. Their different weapons and guns make for a whole new experience depending on who you use, and their weapon actually changes in their hand if you buy a new one.\n[list]\n[*] [b] Joker[/b] - Access to all elements, fast attacks and an all-around beginners character\n[*] [b] Ryuji[/b] - Electric user, Slower bat attacks but do much more damage, focus on Physical skills and tanking\n[*] [b] Ann[/b] - Fire user, Fast whip attacks and fastest gun (Sub-Machine gun), focus on magic skills\n[*] [b] Morgana[/b] - Wind user, Fast sword attacks with a lot or aerial usage, mainly a healer\n[*] [b] Yusuke[/b] - Ice user, Normal sword attacks but with flurry combos, crit monster, focus on Physical attacks\n[*] [b] Makoto[/b] - Nuclear user, Normal fist attacks, all around nuclear powerhouse, an all-around character\n[*] [b] Futaba[/b] - Navigator, non-playable but can provide buffs, healing and protection for the team.\n[*] [b] Haru[/b] - Psy user, Very slow axe attacks but with very high damage, focus on gun attacks and combo skills\n[*] [b] Sophia[/b] - Bless user, Fast Yo-yo attacks with a Rhythm mechanic, high-skill based character but can be used as a healer[/list]\n\n[b] Overworld[/b]\nThe lack of 'daily life' of this game may put off a few from picking this game up, but the amount of interaction in the overworld decently makes up for it's absence. Every city has many NPCs to interact with and all shopkeepers have their own dialogue (and there are a lot of shops). After progression in the story the Phantom Thieves may be standing around town with dialogue of their own [strike] unfortunately it is not voiced[/strike]. They may also hand you requests which furthers the level of interaction you get from your long time allies. Every city looks vastly different from the next with their very own top tier theme, which really helps set each city apart from another. \n\n[b] Music[/b]\nC'mon, it's a Persona game, you should know by now that is has fantastic music, and this game is certainly no exception. From the opening theme all the way till the credits song, in my opinion there is no bad or even mediocre track in the entire soundtrack. Every song fits the theme it requires and makes you want to explore each area in depth just to listen to the smooth Jazz. Speaking of which, p5's Jazz theme has not disappeared, though there is a bit of a metal theme for the more intense battles, which fits the high paced combat perfectly. It's another fantastic job by Shoji Meguro, Lyn, and the whole Atlus sound team.\n\n[b] Graphics and Performance[/b]\nStrikers is a pretty good looking game, the art style of Persona 5 compliments the gameplay of Strikers, using the bold lines and bright colours doesn't get you lost in the fast-paced gameplay. The menu's are the best Persona has ever done, with smooth transitions and every character having a cameo in different sections of the menu. Unfortunately this game was also developed for the switch, which limited how far they could take the graphical aspect of the game. Also this PC port is not the greatest, the cause is unknown but on some systems certain cutscenes will crash the game if viewed in fullscreen. It isn't very well optimised either, enemies will lag out the game using Agidyne, and text looks grainy due to Anti-Aliasing. Overall this doesn't effect the experience too much but it is something to keep in mind if you are debating between buying Strikers on PC or PS4\n\n[b] Story[/b]\nThis is where Persona 5 Strikers really surprised me, as a spinoff I expected a toned down story filled with fanservice to keep the players happy but no. Strikers has a very 'persona-like' story, without the social links. Without a need to build characters (except the few new introductions) Atlus was able to fully focus on the story and make it great from the beginning until the end. The story starts a little weak but really picks up and is definitely on the level of a mainline Persona game story. Each new character fits perfectly into the story and each have their own role to play.\n\n[b] Characters[/b]\nSince this is a sequel to Persona 5 and not Royal, this game does lack Kasumi and any mention of Maruki, but the rest of the Phantom Thieves make their appearance with a new ally - Sophia, a sketchy detective -Zenkichi Hasegawa and an upbeat woman of tech - Kuon Ichinose.\nSophia is 'Humanity's Companion,' an AI Joker discovers in the depths of a Jail. Her main derivative is to learn, as she lost her memory after being dumped into this jail. She accompanies the Phantom Thieves in their trip, inside Joker's phone.  She's bright and bubbly and quite similar to Aigis from Persona 3.\nZenkichi is an employee of Public Security and has been tasked in researching the 'change of heart' epidemic that has swept across Japan. He may be a friend or foe but one thing is for sure, he'll be on your tail this whole trip.\nIchinose is a quirky tech guru that just loves her coding. She just happens to come across the Phantom Thieves and is a HUGE fan. She happily starts working with them to find the true culprit changing these hearts.\n\n[b] Final Thoughts[/b]\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great game to pick up if you're a fan of Persona or hack n slash musou games in general. There is over 100 hours worth of gameplay (including postgame) and it never gets stale. Merciless provides a great challenge in New Game+ and lets you listen to the amazing soundtrack even more.\n\n[h1] FINAL SCORE: 9.1/10[/h1]",

        "content": "[h1] Is this game any good? [/h1]\n\nShort Answer: Yes\n\nLong Answer: Holy crap, the game starts out strong and reels you in with a strong start. The music, the visuals, and the combat.\n\n[b] The Combat [/b]\n\nThe combat is fun, all characters have their strengths and weaknesses. While some characters might be useful against certain types of enemies, they could also be vulnerable to other types of enemies. Every character also has their own unique moveset and combo list. \n\n[b] The Music [/b] \n\nThe music is beautiful, the combat themes, the city themes, the Jail/Dungeon themes. Most games always have an outstanding OST, but they are mainly grounded to big scenarios like boss fights, or alike. However, in this game the music is always charming and the smaller tracks are just as good as the bigger tracks.\n\n[b] The Issues [/b]\n\nThere is not much to complain about though there are a few mishaps.\nFor starters, there are a few times where the game crashes and since this game functions on a checkpoint and manual save system it is a bit distressing having to replay an a chunk of the game due to the game crashing.\n\nAlso a tiny thing is how every time you begin a battle the combat theme will begin playing, but as soon as you finish the fight and get into another the combat theme will play again from the beginning. Though this isn't all too annoying since this game is a spin off from the Persona series where having to hear the same combat theme is something that always happens, which makes this problem a minor one.\n\n[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]\n\n[b] Zenkichi best girl [/b]",

The Dynasty Warriors combat mechanics work surprisingly well with the Persona conventions you're used to, so adjusting to this gameplay style is easier than you think. Each character is interesting and fun to play with in their own way, and you're properly incentivized to use all of them in different compositions throughout the game.\n\nAside from the combat, the rest of the game is familiar territory: Good story, great voice acting and character dynamics, excellent new music (and fantastic mixes on existing tracks), and a few cool surprises. Despite its nature as a genre and studio crossover, this is a genuine Persona game.\n\nIf you're [i] not [/i] a Persona fan already, this one might be a difficult game to sell you on. It's a follow-up with a very involved story that demands knowledge of the original to fully understand. If you don't have access to Persona 5, I would greatly recommend holding off until you play that masterpiece (let's hope they port it to PC). This is a sequel and better experienced after the original; it is not a standalone game.\n\nI don't really have much to criticize here. The only minor complaint I had at all was about the frequency of tutorial interrupts toward the beginning of the game. If you're already familiar with the Persona conventions, there should be an option to prevent or skip those kind of pop-ups and show only the ones relevant to new mechanics like the combat. Especially since the majority of players of this game are likely Persona vets.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic JRPG not just because of how it tells a fantastic story with a set of loveable and memorable characters but also because of how it retains the feeling of playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. The Phantom Thieves, The Mind Blowing Eargasm Soundtrack, the Cinematic Show time and All out Attacks, the Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal design has been also given to Persona 5 Strikers from the layout to the games menu to the animations and cut scenes to the city of Japan to the dungeon which were formally known as Palaces in the meta verse now known as Jails. The Fantastic Story exploring the Meta verse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow while life in the real world goes on as the Protagonist and the rest of the Phantom Thieves are on Summer vacation when things start to go downhill. Persona 5 Strikers is as good as a Season 2 of Persona 5 Apart from missing a few signature system such as Social Links from past Persona games.\n\nStory and Game Structure: \nPersona 5 Strikers takes place and continues the story from Persona 5, just pretend Persona 5 Royal didnt happen and i have to pretend i did not romance Yoshizawa Kasumi the new girl from Persona 5 Royal which was not in Persona 5. Persona 5 Strikers continues to explore the world of the Metaverse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow. The Phantom thieves are back in action to return the desires that have been stolen to their owners while also problem solving the change of hearts not by done by them to the Citizens of Japan, while the threat of the Japanese Bureau persecuting the group looms around. Given how Persona 5 Strikers has been made to be a 2nd Season of Persona 5, it is impressive that it retains the feel and Atmosphere that Persona 5 has. \n\nThe most noteable change to Persona 5 Strikers is probably the confidance system and the velvet room, the velvet room changes make Persona 5 Strikers persona fusion much simpler but the loss of confidance system and side stories that accompany them is what diverges from what a propa Persona 5 Season 2 might be. Instead you gain bond points from fighting along side with the Phantom Thieves or real time events or cooking. While these bond points allowed me to unlock new passive skills and upgrade them, i miss hanging out with the indivisual members of the Phantom Thieves hanging out with them during free time and seeing their side  PeRsOnA-L stories. Not that i mind spending less than 10 000 hours on a Persona game but i can spend any amount of time hanging out with the Phantom thieves even if it means to stop playing other games\n\nCharacters, Soundtrack and Atmosphere:\nThroughout Persona 5 Strikers the Phantom Thieves travel to different locations not just in Japan around Tokyo but to Hokkaido and Okinawa during their summer trip plus investigations but also in the meta verse where combat takes place at. The Dugenons formally known as Palaces in Persona 5 and Royal are now known as Jails and they are large and can take hours to complete. Since the jails that you are fighting in transforms the city around you, travelling back and fourth from the Jails and the real world to stock up on items and replenish HP and SP without taking up time in the real world  from previous Persona games has been implemented in Strikers which makes. Exploring different parts of Tokyo and Japan is a lot of fun just like Persona 5 or Royal even if its for the simplest things such as stocking up on items. Both the Duengons and the Map of Persona 5 Strikers are well desgin and made to be memorable. \n\nThe fan favourite Phantom Thieves are back along side new addition Sophia (Rip Kasumi Yoshizawa from Persona 5 Royal) and i don't think there is any game that i have played that has any more memorable characters than those from the Persona 5 series, while also having different personalities they each have something that will make you fall in love with them. The voice acting and animations are also are very well done. Persona 5 Strikers sound track just like any other Persona game i have played is also mind blowing, memorable and just way too good that it gives me and Ear gasm whenever i am listening to it.\n\nCombat:\nPersona 5 Strikers introduce a totally different style in combat by making players stratagize the use of their Persona skills and other mechanics that were from Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal such as the gun mechanics and the cinematic all out attacks and Show Time attacks. Fighting in Persona 5 Strikers feels good as it feels like im playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal using my Persona skills but also combo-ing skills with the Phantom Thieves that i choose to play as not to mention the different personallties of each character and variety of skills and combos they have. Making use of the enemys weakness in Persona 5 Strikers and using Persona skills is also a important aspect of Persona 5 Strikers as you will want to do enough damage to their weak point to use a All out or Show time attack especially against Bosses and higher level enemys since they usually have a large health pool and can soak up a lot of damage. Every Phantom Thieve in Persona 5 Strikers is playable and they each have different fighting styles and combos you can have up to 4 members of the Phantom Thieves in your party however Joker must be in the squad no matter who you choose to have along side with him. The strategy base mechanics such as using Persona Skills switching members of your party or switching the Phantom Thieve that your are currently playing as becomes even more important or harder difficulties.\n\nPros:\n-The Story of Persona 5 Season 2\n-Retains the Feel of Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal\n-Real time combat with turn base mechanics such as Persona Skils etc while also carrying over Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal mechanincs such as Show-time attacks, Gun uasge and All out attacks etc\n-Mind Blowing Ear-gasm Soundtrack\n-Map and Duengon aka Jails Design\n-Voice Acting and Characters\n\nCons:\n-Occasional Crashes on patch 1.0\n-Unanswered answers for players yet to Play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal\n-No Confidance system\n-Slice of Life system from calander has been cut down\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers story is what a Persona 5 Season 2 might be making this summer vacation and road trip around Japan fun, memorable and loving for fans of Persona 5 and Royal but confusing for anyone new to it.  Persona 5 is one of my favourite JRPGS, it has a mind blowing soundtrack, its world is immersive and relatable filled with loveable and memorable characters and supporting characters alongside a really rich story. The only let down being the Confidance System and the Slice of Life Calander system from previous titles which was missing.",

        "content": "The original Persona 5 is my favorite JRPG of all time, so when I heard that it was getting a Warriors-style spin-off, I was interested but not super excited. I had played Hyrule Warriors and enjoyed it quite a bit but I thought it was lacking in the story department. As more information came out about Persona 5 Strikers (or Scramble: The Phantom Strikers as the fan base knew it before it was localized) it was revealed that it was actually a full-blown sequel to the original game in the style of an action RPG. Now, this was something I could get excited about!\n\nNow that I have finished it, I can say it is a worthy successor to one of my favorite games of all time. Sure, a lot of the social aspects are gone, but that isn't really what Strikers is about. Strikers is a hack and slash road trip for the beloved Phantom Thieves, so if you love P5's cast you'll feel right at home here. HOWEVER, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT PLAYING PERSONA 5. The game assumes you're familiar with the world of that game, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by spoiling the plot of the original game. Seriously, either find a PS4 to play it or hold out a bit longer for a PC port.\n\nAs for the game itself, I found it plays more like Kingdom Hearts than Dynasty Warriors. The combat is fluid and brain-numbingly fun. Each character has unique quirks that make them exciting and fun to play as. Being able to switch between them at a moment's notice makes the combat constantly feel fresh. My only real complaint about the game is that some of the dungeons feel a little hollow, and I think the story leans too heavily into the themes of the first game. Atlus had the opportunity to do something really interesting here, and they do with the addition of some new characters. But a lot of the plot, especially near the end, feels like a retread.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of Persona 5 this is a must-buy. If not, go play the original game and come back to this. I promise you, the style, characters, and story of these games are so instantly loveable and well worth the time sink.\n\nUntil next time, Phantom Thieves.\n\n8/10",

It was fun, that's all i really have to say because there's not much to talk about because this feels like a sequel but at the same time it doesn't in a way where it feels like a different timeline, but what this game really shares is its moments no really big plot twists or story arks it just feels like a extended episode of a cancelled show but overall i really enjoyed this fun road trip with the gang even know there's two missing from it. I guess you could say it was a nice revisit to P5's world again.\n\n7/10       - ATLUS please Remake some of the Persona games",

        "content": "This game honestly lived up to the hype I felt waiting for it for over a year since the Japanese demo on switch. The gameplay is a ton of fun with a lot of personas to mess around with. Music is fantastic as always expected with smt and persona games. Not much could be changed to make this game play better, but on the technical side the game does tend to crash a lot past the first jail, crashing like every 5 loading screens, but that might just be something with my computer. This game is definitely worth the $60 price tag, and has a decent amount of replayability, with a ng+ and an extra difficulty.",

Finally, Persona 5 strikers does have a con for me at least from the first 6 hours and this is that the level design is very bland but the design of the palace is great as always in persona games from the first palace but of course this could be subject to change as I get further into the game other than that I'd recommend Persona 5 Strikers.",

It doesn't quite reach the level of Persona 5's story, but it's still up there on the story tiers. \n\nThe new music tracks in the game are also fantastic, including adding probably my most favourite new battle theme in the Persona series to date. [spoiler]Counter Strike[/spoiler]\n\nIt does seem to have some issues of crashing between load zones rarely and bouts of lag in cutscenes or large areas that tear the audio, though my processor is lower than minimum required so that may be more a me problem than the game. \n\nDespite those problems, I have thoroughly enjoyed what this game has offered. And as of now still have more content to finish up on it. [i]~34 hours of in-game playtime, many of my steam-tracked hours are idling with game on background.[/i]",

        "content": "Will change my review once I get the ability to play it properly, but as it is now it is truly an unplayable game on steam. Don't believe me? check out the page for bugs on steam, and I'm talking about peeps with high end tech that their playing it on, having constant crashes. its ridiculous. and my 7.6 hours of play time? at least four of those hours where spent with just trying to retrace everything i just did in the palace before the last crash, and then id get a little further,  just for it to crash again. wait to buy this product until they resolve the issue of the crashing. There's no auto save in the palaces and you cant manually save whenever you want in the palaces, so unless you like doing every last thing from the last time you saved over and over again, until maybe, just maybe it doesn't crash, then yeah, go for it, get the game. Game play wise, it isn't that bad, really. Its fun, even though the combats not my favorite, but it still feels uniquely persona and that's all I really care about, same with the story, seems like a good old fashioned persona story, which I love... but please, just fix the crashes so I can figure out if the game was even worth the money I invested into it.",

Sophia is a fantastic addition to the Phantom Thieves and both her and Zenkichi are deeply fun to play alongside the existing roster of beloved characters. As with Persona 5, there's not a moment when I'm not excited to take on the next boss or reveal the next plot sequence. PHANtomTASTIC!",

I love getting to see the full cast together in more scenarios that's something that P5 felt lacking in, but here we get to have a wonderful adventure with them and 2 new interesting characters that don't hog the spotlight. It's a great game, well worth the time we had to spend waiting for it. I hope after SMT V we get same day international releases.",

        "content": "Strikers had a lot to live up to as a sequel to one of the best JRPGs of all time, but it somehow delivered. Even though it transitioned from a turn-based RPG to an action-based musou game, it still feels very much like Persona, with every gameplay staple intact. Weaknesses, technicals, elements, baton pass, and more; all wrapped up in a sexy and stylish art style and UI that's basically Persona 5's trademark. I often get bored of musou games very quickly because of it's extremely repetitive nature and simplistic combat, but Strikers does not have this problem at all since, like I mentioned, it has all of the gameplay staples you'd expect from a Persona game, which wildly varies the gameplay and always keeps you on your toes; especially if you play on higher difficulties. The SP system is also back where you can't recharge SP unless you return to the real world, or use items which are either expensive or hard to come by. This encourage you to constantly swap party members so you keep your gameplay variety fresh and entertaining (along with characters getting new passives or skills the more you play as them).\n\nThe only negatives I can really say about Strikers is that there is significantly less real-life activities to do. They are still there, and you can explore and talk to people, but the volume of stuff you can do is significantly lessened from P5. This is because you no longer have a time limit to complete your objective in the metaverse. If you never played Persona 5, this won't really mean anything to you, but to those who have played it, you probably should know that.",

        "content": "Highly recommend it. Playing Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal is not necessary to follow the story, but it does enrich the experience. The characters are fun as always - including the new ones - and the combat actually has a fair amount of depth to it. It uses a lot of the Persona from P5 in a sort of action-rpg type of way, slowing down time to allow the player to pick the correct ability. Also, each playable character has their own unique mechanics, so while you can switch freely between each character and know basically how to play them, there is definitely room to improve with them. All the characters are viable, so I found myself switching them to fit the situation.\n\nThe music is... [i]chef's kiss[/i]. \n\nThe only gripe I have about the game is the lack of social links, or rather the opportunities they offered to spend time with the characters. The Bond system is sort of the replacement here, with completing certain social activities gives points that are dropped into stat-enhancing modifiers, and the ability to unlock new modifiers by doing requests for different characters.\n\nI hope the release of this game and Persona 4 Golden on Steam are signs that Atlus will be bringing Persona 5 Royal to PC, but in the meantime this will do just fine. P5S stands on its own with a well-written story, gratifying gameplay and a reunion (or introduction) with this series' lovable thieves.\n",

I've played Personas 3-5, so hearing that Persona 5 Strikers was gonna be a Dynasty Warriors type game, a genre that I've never tried before, I was skeptical but still wanted to experience the story and see the Phantom Thieves again. Everything this game has shown off to me has put a big dumb smile on my face. The great combat system and bond point system, the returning music tracks along with new ones are always amazing, and the new characters that this game introduces are all great. If you're like me and have played Persona 5 but are on the ropes about trying this game, I highly recommend. Do be aware though, this game takes place after the events of the original Persona 5, not Royal. So don't expect there to be any references or any characters exclusive to Persona 5 Royal. I do also highly advise playing the original or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game in order to understand the Phantom Thieves more and so you're not completely confused on the story. Definitely a worthy GOTY candidate.\n\n10/10",

It's a Persona game first and foremost, but the gameplay within the Jails is pure Musou - even so, the battles are fairly small-scale for a Musou game and, on Hard difficulty, has you actually employ some semblance of strategy as you'll get beaten down if you button mash to victory.\n\nYou still need to pay attention to your Persona's weaknesses and strengths and the best way to use 'em, otherwise you'll just get beaten down and/or the enemy you're fighting will take yonks to beat.  Overall though, this is a grand old time.",

        "content": "A fantastic game, though not without its flaws\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThough the game's story is absolutely great in Persona fashion, it doesn't explore any new themes that Persona 5 Royal hasn't already. It feels like the same story of Persona 5 Royal, only with a different coat of paint. Some of the plot twists in the story (at least imo) can be seen coming a mile away if you pay attention. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal, I guarantee you'll love this game's story, but if you have, just be warned that it might feel repetitive.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in my opinion is hardest in the midgame, when enemies are becoming difficult and you have to strategize to capitalize on their weaknesses as well as dodge their strong attacks. Lategame just becomes a cycle of spamming effective skills to stunlock, AOA, repeat until dead, top off SP as needed with items. I did play on the normal difficulty however, so YMMV.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nA great game in the Persona series, though not without its problems and caveats, but if you're willing to overlook them, I guarantee you that you will enjoy this game, provided you enjoy Warriors-style gameplay loops.\n\nAlso, Sophie is best girl.",

Before the sycophants are like \"Y DIDN U SAV MORE?\" The game locks you into very long periods of time where you cant save and every loading transition is like a game of Russian roulette as far as that goes. I guess it doesn't matter, they got my money anyway. Won't happen again. As far as the game itself its even more diluted SMT mechanics than typical persona games mixed with a shallow musou action game. The gang goes on a scooby-doo esque tour of japan doing what they do. It was ok, but the crashes are beyond infuriating. If you want to play a good action game play devil may cry 5. If you want to play a good SMT game then just google that shit there's like a dozen of those. I doubt this is getting patched to an acceptable state any time soon.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, the font looks like shit. Fix your UI/Font resolution scaling.",

Speaking of the combat, I really love the showtime and all-out attack mechanics! They're super extra and I love it whenever I get the chance to use one.\n\nThe plot of the game may have been a little predictable in some areas *because* it was in true Persona fashion, but it really did not feel detrimental to the game at all and it was still a very enjoyable experience regardless (and it also felt very nice to have a theory forming in your head to turn out to be true too)!\n\nAll in all, P5S really felt like a good and proper sequel game to me despite it not being in the classic Persona game format. Fun, flashy and memorable, this game is definitely going to be on my mind for a while.",

Not recommended if you can't stand a lot of dialogue however, as some sections of the game consist of upwards of 90 minutes of straight dialogue, although these are all skippable if necessary. I would recommend waiting until a bug fix patch however, as I've run into a few crashes here and there, and the game is literally unplayable after about 20-25 hours in, due to a glitch in which after defeating a certain boss the game softlocks itself. Some have been able to get past it, but I personally have tried every fix those who have played past it recommend. Other than the obvious lack of love for the PC port, the game content wise is phenomenal.\n\nTLDR: Amazing game but wait for patch as you literally cannot progress the game at a certain point due to a bug",

So when I heard that P5 was getting the musou treatment? I just had to buy it. All 29 hours I have so far, and I've only just begun the third dungeon. I love this game to death and will sing it's highest praises to anyone who will listen. My only gripe with it though is that it isn't musou enough for me, and the ambush mechanic seems a tad overpowered in this. A couple of friends have told me that bumping up the difficulty alleviates that some, but I can personally manage. I just wish we could of gotten tons of shadows on screen at once like you do in some fights instead of those you quickly ambush, push one button, and then instantly win the fight.",

        "content": "This game is a must buy for people who have played the original or the Royal version of Persona 5 (or at least in cases have watched a playthrough). The story is as funny and emotional as ever and there are improvements on almost every level; The music is great, the characters still keep their development from the last game, the UI somehow tops the original, and the combat is very fun and addicting. I would suggest this game for everybody but the characters often refrence moments and characters from the original game and don't explain complex things over again like the metaverse or Morgana.\n\nThis section is to grade how worth it the digital deluxe edition is:\nThe digital deluxe edition is hard to say the quality off. In order to access the content you need to push the Play button specifically in Steam for the game and it will ask whether you want to play the game or the 'app'. The quality of the app is very sketchy as right from the start it has a Unity watermark at the beginning. It gives you a Digital Art Book, A Behind the Scenes Video, and a Soundtrack Player:\n\nDigital Art Book:\nThe digital art book was disappointing to me. It is nice to see the artwork and some concept art here and there it doesn't have any writing from the artists about what they were trying to do or the challenges they had to face in making it. This is the worst part of the package.\n\nBehind the Scenes Video:\nThe behind the scenes video is pretty much a non narrated documentary that shows how Lyn and Lotus Juice made the opening song \"You Are Stronger\". It mostly focuses on the difficulties of having a non native speaker sing english and it really shows how they are masters of their craft, so much so to where Lyn was able to find out that the reason her singing sound off was because the mic was just 2 inches too low, which is very impressive to me. I'd say if you like Behind the Scenes and Filmmakers commentaries you'll like this, however it should be really easy to find it on youtube.\n\nSoundtrack Player:\nThe soundtrack player is ok. It just feels like a standard music player with a Persona Skin layered over it. The main thing that sucks about it is that you can only listen to the tracks in this player and have to have it open in order to listen to them, no downloads. You're better off just finding the soundtrack on youtube.\n\nThe main reason for wanting to spend $10 extra dollars though would be to have the music play in game. You get some in game items that you won't care about but when you get this edition you get the battle themes of every main line persona game!... except for Persona 5 and Royal... from what I heard you have to have save data from those games in order to get those tracks... which means only Playstation players can get them. However, it is really cool hearing music like, Mass Destruction or Reach Out to the Truth play when you start combat, it even has music from Persona 1 as well which I do not know the name of but really like. If you like these tracks than its only 10 bucks and you get to pick which tracks you dont want to here and in each battle they will randomize which track you get.",

This game assumes you have played the previous game already, and I admire that aspect. This truly feels like a continuation to exactly where things were left off after the main game.

Once everything makes sense to you it can be a fun experience, the story, and characters are the same if not better than in P5. Although the combat may be different its really fun and unique and is a great hash and slash game. If you like persona games, this is a nice spin to the originals. And if you like hash in slashes its also amazing to learn and feel the unique aspects. 7/10. It could have been better but im happy with what it came too.\n\nedit 1: after 100%. 9/10. it good game\n\nedit 2: after playing royal again, this game just humbles you in what to expect in other games. not a good persona game but a good game in general",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers was exactly what I wanted in an action Persona game. It faithfully implements mechanics from the rest of the series in an action combat form. If you play on hard mode, it's a significant challenge and much more fun, as you have to pay attention to what skills the enemies are using on screen.\n\nYou probably should play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first, as there's a lot of references to it that you might miss. You also won't have context on who all these characters are, as the game seems to expect you to know them already for the most part.\n\nYou might think with Koei Tecmo/Omega Force's involvement in development, that this is a musou/warriors game. It is definitely not. It's an action RPG. There are only mini-hordes of enemies, and you actually have to watch what all the little enemies are doing, as the skills they use can cripple you in an instant. You initiate combat on shadows walking around, that burst into multiple enemies. You want to try to be stealthy so you do not end up in a fight you can't win, as well as raising security level in the Jail.\n\nIf you like Persona games (or even Shin Megami Tensei games), I highly recommend checking this out. The story can be a bit nonsense sometimes, but is fun nonetheless. There is no calendar time slot system like in Persona 5. The calendar only moves on with certain story events. You can enter and exit dungeons all you want, and the day will still stay the same.",

Was expecting more traditional dynasty warriors action but i'm still good with the persona style for initiating combat.\n\nMain complaint -  The game randomly closes itself without any warning or errors (in the middle of playing, not on startup).  It's just like nope, I'm done now.  Not sure if it's a common issue.",

        "content": "If you're eye-ing this game then that means a few things: you either played Persona 5/Royal and want more of that, or if you're strictly PC, you're coming from Persona 4 Golden and are curious about this game. Overall Persona 5 Strikers is a unique take on the Persona franchise, and a summary of my thoughts on it could be summed up to *almost* more of the same if you're coming from Persona 5, or a somewhat familiar but also not-so familiar experience if you're coming from Persona 4 Golden, even though this installment in the series has wildly different gameplay from both Persona 5 *and* Persona 4 Golden. Details below.\n\nBefore I talk about anything else though, discussing the story must come first, as Persona 5 Strikers is set *after* the events of the main game of Persona 5 (NOT Royal, as I believe Strikers was released in Japan before Royal debuted anywhere). Following that, naturally the experience is enhanced if you have played Persona 5 from start to finish, and a few things about the mainline title are naturally spoiled. THAT SAID, Strikers actually does a very good job of being vague to the events of Persona 5 with the least amount of spoilers possible, so you can absolutely get away with playing this without playing Persona 5 first. Just be warned that a few things *are* spoiled, so it's definitely not spoiler free.\n\nMoving right along, the plot is written very well I thought; I went into this not actually expecting much, but I came out of it pleasantly surprised. Strikers' storytelling is identical to that of Persona 5 (surprising absolutely nobody), except this time all of your party members are right there from the get go. ATLUS introduces the new characters very nicely; I was fully expecting the new characters to feel a little awkward and forced, but they quickly found their place within the rest of the cast, and by the end they felt like they belonged and have been there all along. At some points, I felt as if Strikers had even stronger story points than Persona 5.\n\nThe gameplay I thought was unique; this game is a full on hack-n-slash beat-em-up type of game, which is very different from the main titles in this franchise. A word of warning that it never really changes its combat up too much throughout the entire game, so it becomes repetitive after a while. I frequently had to take breaks because of how repetitive it can get, and I found myself thinking that taking on additional requests that you get throughout the game to be kind of a chore since there's no real variety in the requests that you get. However, what *is* there is fun; the hack and slash combined with the tried and true persona summons works very well. There are a variety of combos to remember, and each character has their own set, along with their own elemental strengths and weaknesses previously seen in Persona 5. If you've played Persona 5, the old cast will feel pretty familiar as a result. It's worth trying every character out as soon as you're able to as well, since every character plays differently as far as their combos go. Pro tip: make sure you get comfortable with a myriad of party members too. It will not only expand your tool set when confronting powerful shadows, but there's a specific part where you'll have to basically use all of them at some point.\n\nPerformance wise, this game runs very well on my GTX 1080; I didn't see a single frame drop, except for one spot in one of the dungeons which turned out to be a complete one off situation. This game is optimized well, but the only problem is that this game has a tendency to crash when loading into and out of the Metaverse. Please remember to save often, as crashing at some points could mean having to redo tough fights. I myself crashed twice at one specific section and had to play the same section three times total before I finally got through it. Those two crashes were the only crashes I had within my 45 hours of game time, however.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a great hack-n-slash game, and is a very good extension to Persona 5. While the gameplay can get repetitive, overall I had a lot of fun with this title and it really quenched the thirst of wanting more Persona 5 that I didn't even know I had. Highly recommended.",

The Warriors-style gameplay works well for Persona; if you enjoyed Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity then this is also for you. The only issue I've encountered are random crashes, but P-Team rolled out a beta hotfix that focuses on stopping that issue. So props on them for making another great game as well as working hard on squashing bugs.",

While that may seem obvious I have lost hours of progress due to the games seemingly random crashes. I have played the game for 8 hours with no issue but advance in a single mission and the game can crash. It doesn't ruin the game but mainly its just an inconvenience at most.",

        "content": "35.3 hours in the game and just killed the second boss, i can tell from the start its a continuation of p5, at first i was disappointed about the fight style and really wanted the old fighting style but after experiencing, it i like it, when your in the jail (not sure if only me) but you get this feeling that it is unsmooth and also at leblance but suddenly it gets smooth then unsmooth and sometimes your game just crashes, very disappointed about the fact how you spend your character day as in p5 you have many options to wither you want to develop your relation ship with this person or enhance your character's knowledge or buy materials or do the palace and you have a dead line to complete, that what made me like persona 5 and got me addicted to it, its how will you spend your time? but it had been replaced with team bond in p5s.. didnt like the fact that your stuck in this day until you progress until this point, and you dont have a time limit its basically like yes complete this jail in 2 days in persona time! or 3 days, and the fact that you can leave the jail and rejoin with full health and stamina and your still at noon.. [spoiler] i really liked the idea how you unlock the lock for the treasure, the animation was mind blowing! how you spend your bond points is good too, the request is good but didnt really like the quest as if kill this persona with its weakness,[/spoiler] persona leveling up is a bit overpricing especially if you want to keep arsene til the game end, it basically supports changing personas for each boss,  i like the combo but in the same time my controller is going to die because of the spam, really loved the game play and the new mechanism.\n\n[b]spoilers until end of boss2; [/b]\n[spoiler] i really like how the story progressed, and how you can enter the jail using emma and there is this mysterious person behind it, the fact that you can return to the old jails and farm for exp and relooting the chest! how you can move freely while battling and switching between characters is amazing or even the fact that your teammates are healing you without ordering them too,and how you can stop the boss attack by breaking the ice that is in the floor or just shoot the knifes or using the party popper is amazing, i loved how you need to know your enemies past before confronting them, like how alice used to be bullied and you fight her past in order to unlock the treasure room, i also realized that they are facing something similar in order like the first boss in p5 had ann involved with her teacher so she gets in with alic and then in p5 the next victim was madarame whos pupil helped to defeat him \"inare\" so he wanted to help the writer guy, fun fact i hate the detective that is involved in the story as known as \"gramps\", the bond system is good bu as a replacement for the characters relation ship replacement no, [/spoiler]\n\nwill i recommend it for people who just wanted to try persona for the first time? yes and no, yes because the fighting style is good and not like a rip-off game and has good story too! no because you will get lost at first and there are amazing mechanism in persona 5 that hasnt been included in p5s, if you have a ps4 get p5 first then p5s or just watch p5 on yt to know how the phantom theifs started, but what about people who already played p5 and want to try p5s?  then yes i recommend it that is if you want to experience new game style and new features but with the same characters in p5\n\nin my point of view, dont buy it until they fix the crash and the suudden unsmooth game play but you can just buy it now if you dont mind the smoothness game play and the sudden game crash that forces you to leave the game without saving\n\nput in mind there is more positive points but i didnt mentioned it because i dont want to spoil the game more, but all i can say is the fighting style is my favorite!!",

The game is a lot more Persona-like than I thought, since it is a \"Warriors\"-type game, which is a nice surprise.\n\nAt the first real free exploration of the first Palace I have only a few complaints.\n\n1) The game crashed on me after about an hours worth of exploration and dialogue.\n2) The game for some reason takes AGES to load when you boot it up. (I kid you not it takes like 2 whole minutes of just loading after you launch it. Weird.)\n\nEDIT; \n\nThe current beta branch (which I am assuming the full patch will launch some time in the coming weeks) has fixed the crashing/hang ups for people. PLUS, if you're like me and were suffering from long loading times either on launch or just in general (even on an SSD) if you set the game to always run as Administrator it helps a lot, not sure why but hey it was worth mentioning if it helps anyone. :)",

The music is top notch and the gameplay is very fun (I spent nearly all day playing without wanting to stop). Most importantly the characters are back and just as lovable as ever. Every character has adorable and funny quirks and I can't get enough of the whole cast. I can't recommend this game enough to anybody willing to try it.",

        "content": "So... what is Persona 5 Strikers?\n\nShort answer it's Persona 5 the sequel with new flavors mixed in.\n\nBelow are my four key points to hopefully convince everyone who is curious, along with a few other bulletpoints.\n\nFirst and foremost, there are NO SOCIAL LINKS-now, most people would be upset by this, and yes, it is technically a loss for the series as a whole, but it's not quite as big of a deal as you'd might think. You get to interact with the party and the cutscenes you share with the Phantom Thieves are all quite cozy and just plain JRPG comfort food. \n\nSecond, this is NOT turn based combat, it's a sort of spin on Dynasty Warriors, meets active RPG, meets mild turn based mechanics. Sound messy? It is when you first jump in, but after everything is explained to you? You'll be gliding through combat like a beast. Essentially you have buttonmashing combos to take out trash, you can add some spice by changing what buttons you hit for different actions to occur. Whenever you press the \"Summon\" key (the key to actively bring out your Persona, you are given a list of spells and abilities to select from, time is halted during this. Additionally, there is gunplay, all you do is target enemies with a gun and fire at them--time slows down to like 1/8th speed during this mechanic.I will note that despite this being in the \"Dynasty Warriors\" archetype of games, I find it an unfitting description. This is still an RPG, and the boss fights DO require some strategy, if you run in mashing you will not have much success on these fights, on top of this, it feels less tiresome because you see when encounters are going to occur as opposed to your map just being flooded constantly with enemies.\n\nThird, ever wanted to play as any of the other Phantom Thieves? Guess what, that's a thing this time. In fact, it's an encouraged mechanic-the Baton Pass system in this one can help you juggle powers by switching characters when prompted-it can get nasty if done right. On top of the Baton passes, each character has a set of \"Mastery Skills\", and these were just delightful treasures, I remember each time I unlocked a new one for a character (four mastery skills per character)  I couldn't help but laugh and think \"That sounds overpowered\", oh yeah, they all felt that way-if you know how to play and use the characters skills? You'll turn into a monster on the battlefield. \n\nFourth, the freaking music. Dear god. The. Freaking. Music. This game follows the standard Persona series tradition of having music that's just outright amazing-the fact that they give you the soundtrack with this is simply amazing. I cannot endorse this game's music enough. If you've played the series previously, you know what to expect.\n\n\n\nA few other things.\n-Dynamic artstyle that looks just as flashy as always.\n-Lower system requirements, meaning some older rigs out there can run it.\n-Japanese and English voice options (both are wonderful, and all voice actors returned for their roles.)\n-Game is optimized for any controller type, I normally wouldn't think I'd have to mention this, but I just played another title that was not equipped for all controller types. \n\n\n\nI've bought a plethora of games on Steam, and done a small handful of reviews. (I owe another JRPG a review... better get on that one too.) This is one that I strongly encourage you all to purchase and play. It's a solid experience and worth your time. Ideally, this will also give Atlus the incentive they need to release all future (and perhaps previous) SMT titles on PC so I don't have to own a console for the sole purpose of their games.",

It's not turnbased. Check it before buying game, and if u dont dislike it just give this game a try. It's really nice!\n\nSecond thing you may dislike is new amount of social events. \nDays in P5S don't go one by one, but change, when you progress the story. Therefore there is no time for life events and social links like in normal persona game. \n\nThird thing, that makes game not so fun is persona fusing, I completely loved the system in P5R, but here your fuses give you less then something\nYour personas can not change their combo abilities, there is no res/null/drain abilities, to give them in fusion. \nThere is no itemize, but you dont really want to have skill cards, until its passive skill\nAnd I dislike Persona Points, You just always make transition in buy fo yen/sell for points -> repeat \nI understand, that Null/Drain/Repel Yoshitsune completely breaks rules, but cmon. All this fuse circus always was about making incredible power level personas.\nHere you fuse them,you can up their stats, but all this is just to don't suck at power level and have personas default drains/nulls.\nI cant say that its minus, cos now fights are a little more about your dodges and combos, not about 1st turn hassou tobi. It's still about debilitate/Matarukaja+Masukukaja+Marakukaja, but now it's diffirent. Just give it a try\n\n+++++++++++++++\nCooking and dialogues about food are awesome\nLevels are memorable\nMusic (thanks to Lyn) is absolutely perfect, funky and took my heart\n\nI recommend to buy this game to everyone. who isn't afraid of new combat system and wants to try something new with good old friends",

        "content": "This game is a solid 6/10. \n\nI would say it's an interesting game and definitely has a cool new way of fighting. But for some reason the game is so damn boring. \n\nI think it's because I pre-ordered Persona 5 when it was first announced. Then also got the Royal version too and spent so much time on them that they are leagues better than this game. I think if your new get the original ones but if you have played them this maybe a okay DLC/Extension to the game\n\nHere is my overview: \n\nThe story is pretty much the same with weaker reasons\nThe fact that Joker feels like the weakest character \nEvery other character besides Joker feels really nice to play as my favorite is Ryuji \nThat you can't multi select or buy \nThe Persona system is more toned down\nCombat is cool at the start but very boring and repeat the same thing over and over again\nIt's like this - In a Dynasty Warriors game you fight large armies with your character but feel like a Badass. In this game when you start a fight you have to wait for a cut-scene. You're not a badass (Oddly since it's after the main game and you're basically a GOD KILLER) and the persona drops are a bit random.\nThe camera is odd when you do a spell/persona attack it doesn't reset the camera and there's no button for it to rest the camera. \nThe mini Map doesn't rotate - For me this is super annoying\nSeems like a lot of random stuff just to do the same fights over and over again \nOh and there's so many tutorial pop-ups I thought the original Persona 5\u2019s were bad but this is so much.\n",

Set to Hard mode if you want any sense of challenge.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can say that this feels like a Persona game. Story, Character, Fantastic voice acting, it's all there. I've never been a Dynasty Warriors fan because all they ever do is rehash the same thing over and over again, and it rarely has any substance. They made a terrible Fate game series, an ok Zelda series, but they finally figured something out. (Of course, Atlus was there to watch over development like a nosy teacher looking over a child doing their homework. But this teacher knows how to teach properly.)\n\nThere hasn't been any problems with the game. You know, like real games when they were released when they were ready. No EA \"We'll fix it later\" shit. \n\nHow The Game Plays: This feels like a Persona game. Let me emphasize this. The battles still have a bit of strategy to them. You can't just run blindly in (at least on Hard difficulty) and wack hack away. And for people who don't want to play a game with battle substance, or the possibility of losing, you have Normal mode. If your 6 year old brother wants to play, you got easy mode. It's perfect. They got a difficulty for all types! And you don't have to start the game over if you find out Normal doesn't cut it 2 hours into the game like I did. \n\nPersona fans will enjoy this. Dynasty Warrior fans will enjoy it. People who hate reading, plot, and character development will despise it. But I suppose if you hate reading in the first place, you probably didn't read this far.\n\nEdit: Beat the game. This is THE BEST Dynasty Warriors game. Better than Dynasty Warriors, better then Zelda, etc. I only wish Makoto would call me back....",

        "content": "If you're a fan of persona but want something faster paced, this is a good pick up.  The game is definitely shorter than the main SMT games, even if you try to 100% the game.  However, in true SMT nature, hard mode has its difficulties, and easy mode makes grinding bareable.  It has all the feels of a post persona 3 game, just condensed, but never had I got the feel that the game felt rushed.  The dungeons are built so that they don't feel repetitive (unless you're looking to 100% the game, in which case of course you'll need to go out of your way to do some side quests).  For a spin off game I'd give this a solid 8/10 objectively, and 8.5/10 as a SMT fan.",

        "content": "Pros:\n- Good story, worthy of being a great sequal\n- Combat is easy enough to get used to\n- Both Japanese and English dubs do an amazing job at voicing characters\n- 60 FPS is great compared to 30FPS\n- Zenkichi and Sophia are great additions to the main cast\n- No time progression if you exit a jail, and no deadline to complete anything (aside from treasure demons)\n\nCons:\n- Random crashes, usually in cutscenes/transitions after a jail\n- Infinite loading/black screen after you beat the 5th jails boss\n- Game can only run FPS up to 60FPS\n- 3rd jails boss is a huge difficulty spike\n- Maps can sometimes be disorientating\n- Not a lot of characters from the first game reappear\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend getting this game for the great story to finish up the Phantom Thieve storyline, but only once ATLUS have fixed a lot of issues and bugs with the PC port.",

        "content": "I make this review very subjective as i played all 'Persona' titles and having a certain expectation.\n\nMainly I feel P5 Strikers lacks of Persona 5 original charm, and i was hoping with P5 Royal like expectation where Royal was extravagant but still delivers 'cool teenager' experience.\n\nI did played musou game like DW and SW, where it makes me as player feel very powerful, but it isn't when i play Strikes. Instead i feel frustrated as the enemies(especially the strong one) are very not balance until i reach 'not fun' point. Fair point i play the game in hard mode, but in Royal i played 'Merciless' difficulty in first playthrough, but it was still very doable and feel very fun. I know it's a different genre, but by holding 'Persona 5' title it should reach a same experience.\n\nP5 Strikes also feels very boring for me. It's repetitive and defeating enemies isn't satisfying. I think it's a problem in UX delivery, where in any original Persona's battle we potentially see something new like new enemy, new potential persona, new item, yada yada yada. Strikes has a contradiction design, while ambushing enemy is using same approach as Persona 5, but then every battle information is using musou game style, for example every item and new persona shown in the mid battle. How the **** i could see that in the mid of chaos, why not just using Persona 5 style T_T where everything we got is shown in the end of battle. This problem leads to I feel I don't get anything and not rewarded, heck i even often didn't know i have a new persona. Fusing a new persona is also not really that exciting, as i know i will be pummeled again by the enemy. It's unfortunate where Persona 5 main strength is UI/UX with their very awesome style.\n\nAnd lastly no Kasumi is a huge experience gap and it feels strange for me.",

        "content": "Edit: After the hotfixes the game has been error free and I can recommend this game now. It has worked on everything I have put it on lately and that's a sigh of relief. Enjoy the game! I will not delete the original review because it is important to note issues at launch.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI want to start off by saying this game is an amazing game and a full 10/10... WHEN IT WORKS! I have a beast of a PC and the game runs super well when it decides to. However the game crashes over and over again. It will do so completely randomly as well. And to me I save every chance I can get and still end up losing 20 minutes to an hour each time. of the 26 hours clocked only 17 are on my file because I have lost that much time in the game due to random crashes. \n\nMost of the crashes occur during loading screens. However I did experience one crash in the middle of dialogue and another in the menu. Again I love this game but after the 12th crash I have decided enough is enough. I will suffer the bugs and crashes to finish this game but I DO NOT suggest anybody even try this game until they fix their crashing issues. As a huge fan of the Megaten series I am severely disappointed in the lack of QA for this game. I only have thios here on steam but I have read reports of the PS4 version also crashing on PS5 so it seems the console ports have issues as well although I would imagine far less. \n\nI appreciate the challenge and old feel of a Dedicated area to save (you can only save in the real world or checkpoints in the Jails) but because of a lack of a Autosave feature the crashes have become unbearable. \n\nMy luck is terrible as it has crashed at the worst possible times for me including after an hour of gameplay that could not be saved between. An autosave would have saved me the anger from losing that. Even then I feel like I have given enough time to this game for it to not just be a one off issue.\n\nFor the love of god I hope Atlus and Sega will FIX THE CRASHES! Unacceptable!\n\nEdit: I switched from my Samsung Evo 970 Plus to my SATA Samsung QVO 860 SSD and the crashes completely stopped. I switched back and it crashed. If you have a laptop with only an NVME drive stray from this game as it bugs out with them. I still think it's the Denuvo DRM lacking support for the NVMe drivers. They need to fix this and last I checked there were no Update patches yet. If they release one I will test and update the review once again.\n\nGame is fantastic though. Just be aware that you need a Outdated ancient technology to avoid crashes. Which is still unacceptable of a positive review. Get this on PS4 instead.\n\n\nMy Specs are\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600X\nMSI X470\nNvidia RTX 2060 Super\n32GB 3600MHZ DDR4 Ram\nWindows 10 Pro\n1TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus NVME SSD\n1TB Samsung QVO 860 SATA SSD\nKingston 480GB SATA SSD\n2x 4TB 7200rpm HDDs in Raid 0\n\n(I have tested it on all storage drives and it only crashes consistently on the NVMe drive)",

I do have a few complaints, like how the ability to return from jails without time progressing making it so that HP and SP recovery items don't really have a use since you can just fully recover those by leaving and returning. Despite a few more gripes, I very much enjoy this game.",

But I can only recommend this game if your PC is capable to run it properly without issue, or if you have a PS4 and/or Nintendo Switch (which i imagine, the console versions run just as good)",

The game even has some postgame content. If you liked persona 5 and enjoy action games, this is a must play.  My only 2 big complaints with the game are that the bosses are damage sponges and the story can be pretty similar to the original at times. Overall though, I really enjoyed it and plan to continue with postgame contest and get 100%",

All we need now is for Atlus to release Persona 5/Royal on Steam for us PC players to enjoy even more!",

Cannot recommend in it's current state\n\nEDIT: As of now, I have figured out a fix to the long loads but nothing for the crashing. If you want to fix the loading time without having to disable dlc, simply go to the local game files of the game, find the game launcher, right click on it and go into properties. Then you go to compatibility and check run program as administrator. It may not work the first time but after awhile of reloading I finally got good load times. However, crashes still plague the game. This is also a good fix for the infamous black screen after beating the fifth jail.\n\nEDIT: As of now, I beat the game and just went into New Game +, for some reason now crashes are practically non-existent and loading times being fixed all in all make the experience very enjoyable, as of now I highly recommend",

It has a lot of what i wanted in the original Persona 5, the phantom thieves acting more like friends rather than teammates, because everyone is introduced immediately, the game has freedom for you to see them acting as friends, the writing is consistently witty and actually funny and not forced, and even while going through the \"palaces\" of the game (which they are called jails now), there is so much idle and situational dialogue it genuinely feels great to see everyone interacting with each other. \n\nThe combat is smooth and slick and keeps the absolute overwhelming sense of style as in the games prior, every character has their own gimmicks and unlockable techniques if you play as them for long enough, adding something new and it never once felt as if im forcing myself through battles, when you're strong, the game makes you feel like it and its just so cool.\n\nThe story and new characters we're also very interesting and the final parts of the game felt very reminiscent of the final palace of Persona 5 Royal, which is a nice touch, you also unlock the og Persona 5 and Persona 5 royal battle music after beating the game, as well as some extra things that add replay value to the game.\n\nThe only downside is, as I'm sure you've heard, the game is not a stranger to crashing, while my game has crashed only twice, i suggest saving very often when you are playing the game since when you crash, you have to go back to your latest save file,  hopefully these problems get fixed. \n\ntldr: its a very great experience and more of the Phantom thieves we know and love, with a DRIPPY soundtrack and combat, i say it's worth the price, i cans see the love that went into this game. It can crash but the only way to remedy that for now is to just save as often as you can. A very solid experience.\n",

This feels like a nice second course and dessert to the original, that I am so glad we got.  I will post a more in depth review after completing the game",

This game was not ready for PC it's a great game but if you're one of the many people out there that can't load into the main menu then good luck the fix out there is to put into window mode but this game refuses to do window mode I literally have to watch the game exit out and launch until it goes into window mode \n\nso the fix is something you need to do yourself and do to how game studios dont like talking about inner workings but it also explains so much it got to do with nvaida and amd hopefully this will help people out or point them to the fix\n\nstill will not recommend this game till a official fix and that means everything. \n",

        "content": "As of now, I have not finished the game yet, so I can't say anything for the story. I'll admit, however, I'm not expecting anything all too great. Most of the Persona series' spin-offs have been middling at best to outright boring at worst when it comes to any storytelling, so I'm not all too invested on that front.\n\nBut the rest of the game is pretty damn good insofar. The characters are all on-brand, thankfully not being the victims of flanderization. The new main cast members aren't annoying, which is more than I can say for most of the past Persona spin-off casts. \n\nThe actual game-play is much more in-depth than I was ever expecting it to be. Where in past warriors-esque titles you could mindlessly button-mash, you still do that. But in this case, it feels like you have to also employ a sense of strategy to how you approach the game. Then again, it may just be because I am playing on hard mode and your party could very well be dead in just a few hits if you aren't all too careful. If I had any complaints about the combat at all, I don't like how it makes the bosses HP sponges that you just gotta wade through. On hard, that shit is simultaneously highly rewarding whilst also being highly annoying. Rewarding in that you're constantly engaged in the combat and you have to be paying attention to every little detail; annoying in that if you slip up only just a couple of times, that's it. You're done.\n\nMusic and presentation carries over from the original game. I honestly believe it to be the standard to which any self-respecting JRPG should strive for, and that continues on into Strikers. \n\nAll-in-all, I recommend the title to any fans of the series. Or, although I don't recommend going about it this way, if you're not interested in the story and are just looking for a solid tactical action game, then I guess you could play it if you can stomach the anime bullshit along the way.\n\nNow bring Persona 5 to PC Atlus.",

BUT, there is some issues that is holding back the game of its full potential, this includes, game crashes and a bit of camera problem.\n[b] P.S:[/b] i added spoiler text, be warned.\n\n[b]- Crashes:[/b] i have gotten several crashes/freezes toward my playthrough in P5S, First crash is during [spoiler] Alice's [/spoiler] jail, during this Jail, i have gotten a crash that made 3 or 4 of my first hours worthless as i did not save and had to start at the beginning where i met Sophia. Second, is a freeze,after the gang defeated [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] and leave the Jail, it suddenly froze and i wasn't even sure if it was loading or not since there was no phantom thieves Logo.\n\n[b]-camera issues:[/b] for me, the camera was a bit annoying as it started to clip through objects like trees and walls, making it hard to see. easily can copy the camera movement from other hack and slash game (dynasty warriors or god of war 1,2 or 3) but did not and feels like the camera is fighting agaisnt me.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]  the game is amazing, The story, the returning characters, the new characters, the twist, the adventure. But there are way to many problems in this current build and is holding the game back. Wait till patches and updates come out for the game if you are thinking of purchasing this game.\n\n[b] edit:[/b] also, after the [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] boss fight, my game wouldn't load, i have restarted the game even my computer numerous times, i cannot continue onward after that, so the game is unplayable for me, please fix this issue ASAP.\n\n[b] edit 2: [/b] so, after Atlus/Sega fix the issues by giving it a more stable platform shape as a hotfix, i can finally continue the game. After finishing it, one thing is certain, it a rollercoaster of emotions and after they fix it, definitely recommend this game to Persona lovers, even thought its no longer a  J-RPG, they certainly put the effort to make the hack and slash aspect better. Now, i can finally say with certainty...i definitely Recommend this game.",

The game takes several aspects from the original Persona 5, in terms of plot points and themes. Characters like Haru Okumura gain lots more screentime than previously. The game will give you a good time guaranteed, regardless of the type of player. I highly recommend for persona fans or people who love action, RPGs or even just enjoy an anime aesthetic. There is something for everyone (if you are above the ESRB rating).",

Roughly 30 - 50 hours long, so plenty of content but not so much to be a turn off to those who cannot commit 100+ hours like you must in P5 and P5R. Very much worth the purchase.",

I can't recommend picking up the PC version right now. \n\nThe reason I say that is because of the random crashes that seem to occur during loading screens. I'm currently stuck in the beginning part of the first palace where you meet a certain character, and every time the part tries to load me out of the palace it crashes and I lose all my progress as there's no way to save from that moment on, I've done this section of the game 2-3 times already and I'm afraid it will continue on into later portions of the game,\n\n8/10 honestly would be a 10/10 if not for the crashing issues.",

        "content": "Do I recommend this game? Easy answer, yes! Complicated answer, wait a little bit.\nFirst, as much as Atlas says this is a standalone title, it really isn't. As far as I gotten into the game, there were many past references to the original Persona 5 game (unfortunate how it's only on ps4/ps5 for now\u2026) If you haven't already, play the first game. Ignore royal, waste of time haha. Besides that, I would consider it a direct sequel to Persona 5. Ever play Bayonetta (a very fun game as well, totally recommend)? It's very similar to Strikers, pretty much going into the \u201chack and slash category\u201d. I would suggest you use a controller too unless you have long flexible fingers. Keybinds for keyboard are kinda all over the place, so if you have the patience unlike me, Strikers supports change of keybinds (controller still recommended). Now, performance wise\u2026. Considering that it's a new game, there are lots of random crashes, and bugs here and there which ruins the entire persona experience, which is why I believe you should wait to buy this game till a patch gets pushed out. BUT! This game is great, takes elements from its different titles and mixes them. You will definitely know it's a Persona game, because of its catchy music and cool game art esthetics. 10/10.\n",

It shows that the production for this game is very heartful. Meaning that Atlus believes in their game and decide to put their heart into it's developement. \n\nNow Atlus please put Persona 5 Royal on Steam.

        "content": "Just wait, guessing SEGA decided that the DRM was more important than the game stability so I have to put down the controller and hop onto P5R while what I'm guessing is the porting team fix their screw-up with the PC version that causes crashing and lengthy load times.\n\n= Do note that the community has already found workarounds to fix just about everybody's issues. I myself used the nvidia control panel fixes (plus setting the exe to run as admin) and it has completely solved the load time and load crash issues I've suffered. (as far as I can tell atleast)\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, yes even those that have already played Persona 5. First off this game is fully based on the Persona 5 Original version of the world, not the Royal remake. If this bothers you please keep in mind that this game was released in Japan long before Royal was made. Keep in mind that this game also happens after the events of P5 so I fully recommend you play P5 first unless you came here specifically for the combat system over the story, at that point you'll be fine most of the major plot points revolve around current happenings anyways, I myself came for the story so...\n\nPoint on the combat system. If you already played P5 or P5 Royal you might have issue with the combat system as it takes the, beat the life out of waves of enemies with everything you got, approach over the turn-based quality over quantity enemies that the mainline games have. The fusion system is slightly simplified as is the persona strengthening system. You are slightly screwed out of you're previous sources of items, armor, and weapons, but in turn you have and adorable new character who will handle most of your material needs. You also have Joker's awakened cooking abilities and a 100% fixed flow of time, also UNLIMITED TRANSIT between the real world and the metaverse, due to the shorter in-game time you are given to clear the palace. DAYS WILL ONLY PASS ALONGSIDE STORY PROGRESSION. No getting bad ends because you spent to long getting pestered by Mona to sleep. There is also a million other little things you'll learn as you play that differ from the mainline games but you'll learn them fairly easily.\n\nI dearly love the Persona games alongside it's older edgier cousin. And so far the game has been amazing for a spin-off of a spin-off series. You do have to look at it like persona Q in that it is fairly different from the game or games that it spawned from. Igor is once again eating popcorn far away from the side disaster probably drinking tea with his boss. So just, realize that like a lot of games, you won't know how much you'll enjoy a game till you play it or see the systems in action.",

        "content": "While this game is a great sequel to the Persona 5 storyline, the gameplay is wildly different that some players may be put off at first if they were just expecting another Persona 5.\n\nReally need to have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal to understand the background of a lot of the characters and appreciate the connection a lot of them experience in the game. The story itself is pretty stand-alone, but the interactions that some of the characters experience or reference aren't.\n\nCombat itself, while intensely different from the mainline game, is quite enjoyable both from the standard attacks, various ways the different characters you can control function, the way weaknesses are handled, all the way to the All-Out Attacks not just being a 1-hit KO necessarily. All of the systems provide depth to the combat, but don't complicate it too much to allow the player to still fully master it in the course of normal gameplay.\n\nStory, Voice Acting, Music, all are Top Notch just like the mainline Persona 5 game. All are accentuated by no Confidant system being in this game like in Persona 5. While that might be a detriment in some aspects of truly getting to know some characters and having more 1-on-1 interactions between characters, it can also help keep the story going at a smooth pace with how the 'dungeons' are laid out.\n\nBoth a pro and a con at the same time in different aspects, is the fact that there is no time/day management in this game like in the Persona mainline games. This means that there's not as much planning needed for those that were hoping for that aspect. However, it also means that players can go back and truly explore and 100% the 'dungeons' and such without worry that they will miss something because they mismanaged their in-game time/dates.",

I'll leave my original review below for two reasons. First, according to other reviews, the crashes are still a major issue for some people, so I might have just gotten lucky, and people should be aware of it. Second, I think it pretty accurately expresses what I love about the game.\n\nIf they fix the crashes, this is an amazing game. If they fix the crashes, I can give this a positive review. If they fix the crashes, I can talk about how this game brings back the same feeling I had playing Persona 5. If they fix the crashes, I would recommend this to both Musou and Persona fans alike. If they fix the crashes, I can say that this actually feels like it would even appeal to people who weren't ever fans of either. Please fix the crashes, This game obviously had a lot of effort and love poured into it, especially for something that I was expecting to be a quick cash-grab. There's no reason it should have the negative reviews that it does. It truly is amazing if only it lacked the technical issues. I've only put ten hours into the game so far, and I've already had it crash twice so catastrophically that I had to restart my computer.",

        "content": "I liked the combat system in this game, the transitions into combat is much faster and enjoyable than the classic turn base mechanic in the original Persona 5. Don't get me wrong I do like that system. This game is more easy to understand and defeat enemy opponents as you get to know their weakness from the start with the third-eye ability and Futaba analysing the enemy mid & start of combat. Which makes sense since this game is based right after the original Persona 5 game. So Joker would know all enemies weakness and what persona mask he should use to strike their weakeness.\n\nWhen you have the correct characters while in the jail you can then use them to strike the enemy weakness and do massive amounts of damage, they do have environmentals attacks in sum jails that can alleviate the problem of accidentally initiating combat with characters that do not have the correct abilities to strike the enemy weakness. On the other hand, you can just max out Joker's slots with persona masks from fusion or the compendium in the velvet room, and hope he has the right mask with the right ability to strike the enemy weakness during that combat situation but that's inefficient as it would just deplete Jokers stamina making him useless, unless you pump him with items that can recover his SP.\n\nHowever, a solution they can introduce is that I would loved for them to bring back the ability to switch out characters during combat by idk a bond upgrade since they removed the social aspects from the game.\n\nAnother thing I kinda dislike is the inventory system, I hate having to pause the combat to then scroll down a ton of purchased items to find the correct item to use to for example recover SP to a character that's out of stamina. \n\nA solution they could add to fix this would be a redesign in which they categories the inventory to have HP items in one section, SP items in another and lastly the curables ailments items in different sections for quick and easy location and applying the item on said character that needs it.\n\nI will not mention story as I would like to not spoil it for any persona fan that hasn't played it but overall it a good hack and slash game and story in my opinion does seem kinda rushed but it's great.\n\nFor price, I would loved to have paid \u00a310 less but I'm still happy with my purchase. As the game is fun and enjoyable. As well as I did it so that ATLUS & SEGA can bring Persona 5 Royal onto steam once they see that the Persona series makes them bank (I will not of course pay for it if the price of the game is ridiculous and instead wait for it to be on sale) on PC, and they finally release a port.",

I WAS PISSED. You would think for a $70 game I I bought deluxe) they would give you a perfect gaming experience but nope. In total it crashed on me about 6-8 times. It was very annoying that you had to do it again. It was horrible and painful. I honestly think we all deserve better than this if we are paying a premium price for a game. \n\nFor the game itself, I personally don't like Dynasty Warrior type of game play but Persona 5 strikers make it fun by adding many elements like fulfilling side quests and meaningful story. I was a bit irritated now I have to go to Playstation 5 for Persona 5 but not playing that beforehand did not affect my understanding to the story. Overall it was a great game, yet there is serious stability issue and I think players should get compensated for going through the hassle of force exit during game play. It wasn't released on early access for goodness sake.",

I'm usually not a fan of Musou game, but this one actually includes a lot of the Persona 5 identity from the main game, and it's always a pleasure to meet the Phantom Thieves one more time !\nHowever, I can't recommend the game right now because of one single (big) issue : the random crashes. In only 4h of playtime, I had 6 crashes, always happening at random moments (in battle, during dialogue...). I save every time it is available, but the game being pretty heavy on dialogue, chances are you will be crashing during one of those and have to restart from the last save point. I had to start a new game 3 times because the game would always crash before I reached the point where the save function gets available... There is nothing more frustrating than finally beating a hard boss then have the game crashes during the dialogue afterwards, forcing you to play the whole section again and pray that this time it won't crash.\nSo until that serious issue is fixed, I can't recommend the game (yet), which is a shame because it is actually a great game.",

The fact that there aren't to many games today that do this is a shame.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy both turn based and warrior type games, so the switch in style is no problem for me (sad to see the game get some hate on account of this). From my point of view, the way they incorporated Persona 5 mechanics into this game is well done. Even tho there is button mashing involved, I often find myself looking at it from a strategical point of view (which character should I use, what enemy should go down first, what buffs/debuffs to use, should I use SP move or combo etc)\n\nRegarding the story, at this point in time I can't say much, but so far it meets my expectations. I do miss some aspects that have no been included, mostly secondary character stories (as Persona 5 does have some nice characters), but I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nI did experience some crashes, however in my 30h of gameplay, this only happened twice, none of which have been in crucial moments like boss fights, or even jail exploring, so I can't say I've been bothered that much (would still be nice to get these patched tho).\n\nWhile exploring you will see objects popping in and out of existence, but usually it's small stuff, like rocks and to be honest, most of the time I hardly notice them (since I'm usually looking out for enemies, chests, junk and so on).\n\nDespite the flaws mentioned above, I still think it's a great game and would recommend it to any fan of the series and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to enjoy Persona 5 Royal as well. ^^",

(Also side note Futaba is still best girl with Takamaki coming in 2nd Makoto comes in 3rd and finally we have Haru) The bonus stuff is actually pretty good with a music player and new music as well as in game stuff to behind the scenes stuff which is pretty cool. It is cheaper to get the deluxe edition bcuz it comes with all the dlc so save yourself $5 and get the deluxe edition. Anyway dope game hopefull we P5 and P5R soon for pc cuz 60 fps is so good for a game like this.",

This game isn't the same as the other Persona games,but it's still a persona game. Badass OST, stylish finishing moves and other Persona 5 stuff, almost all of it is here. Having to meet Phantom Thieves again was fun[spoiler] Not meeting Akechi though was a bummer [/spoiler]. And there is a lot of fan service [spoiler] The dialogue when Joker acted as a decoy in the first jail was pretty funny ngl(when Ryuji said is this a deja vu and other dialogue that came before it) [/spoiler] I haven't completed the game yet(only finished the first dungeon) but i would give it a 8/10. Totally would recommend!",

        "content": "POST PATCH REVIEW 4/20/2021: It brings me great joy to finally update this review to a storngly recommended, as the newest patch has just released that appears to fix the crashing. I was able to play an additional 2 hours tonight with no crashing, and plan to do a second playthrough on NG+ soon. This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed. In my playtime, I have experienced nearly 2 dozen crashes and while with habitual saving the consequences can be mitigated it is extremely frustating. I shouldn't have to play in constant fear of random crashes, possibly even caused by the DRM. Until the crashing is resolved, don't buy this.",

        "content": "[b]Persona 5 Strikers[/b] on the surface may seem like another musou-game spinoff. While it certainly draws inspiration from the genre for its core combat, Strikers goes above and beyond in making the game its own, rather than solely adopting the warriors style and nothing else.\n\n[b]The story[/b] follows up several months after the events of the original Persona 5 game. The crew eager for summer vacation discover the metaverse is still active and people are manipulating a new AI program, \"EMMA,\" to steal the desires of those around them for various reasons. They take to the road to sniff out these \"Jails\" and steal back the desires of the public. All in all, the story is pretty fun for what it is, but don't be expecting the same heavy hitting and deeply metaphoric narrative structure Persona 5 had delivered. Strikers definitely reigns it back a bit, and plays out more like a fun action anime tale.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] is pretty addictive. Being a fan of warriors games in the first place, I'm naturally drawn to hack 'n slash fun, but Strikers adds many of its own series' elements to the formula to spice things up. First, you are no longer on a day-by-day system when using the metaverse. Rather, you can phase to-and-fro reality as you please to restock and refresh. The fight encounters are similar to the original persona game, but then the hack 'n slash starts. The key factor here, is that you will be fighting basic shadow hordes, but a lot of Personas as well. This means you have to watch out for your own weaknesses and debuffs, but you can use your team's personas to fight against them as well.\n\nPersona registration, fusion, and strengthening are still here, and being able to collect, mix, and level up personas and skills to help you fight different types of enemies is addictive and just fun.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: of course its great I don't even need to say anything.\n\nIf this game lacks anything, its simply being a spinoff means there are no social links, variable dialogue or story options, etc. Its a very linear action game, so besides your personas and equipment the sense of control and planning isn't really there. But this makes sense, as its is a different class of game, mixing in elements from its true form.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of hack 'n slash games to enjoy this. If you love action games with flashy visuals and great music, this is for you. And if you simply LOVE persona 5, this is definitely for you, as the entire existence of Strikers simply stands as fan service for the biggest of fans.\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]",

        "content": "Strikers is a beautiful blend of the JRPG and Musuo genres, taking the tight action and combo oriented gameplay of a Musuo and laying it over top a traditional dungeon crawling Persona title. The story is well written, and feels like a true successor to the ORIGINAL Persona 5.\n\n With no references to Royal, due to the different teams in different studios working on these games side by side, it leaves itself open to, potentially, DLC. I would hope for it, but it's doubtful as the game has already been out in Japan for a year without any mention of DLC. It's a fantastic game, if you're a Persona fan, don't let the idea of the combat turn you off, it's executed very well, and more in line with a Persona game that's taking queues from action titles than it does something like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back, and they've never felt more agile or more stylish, and they're ready to steal your heart once more.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

For persona fans this a large departure, time management is not a factor and the battles are real time rather than turn based, at its heart this is an action game with some RPG elements rather than a full on RPG.",

        "content": "Persona 5 meets Musou. This direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 plays similar to the Warriors type games but there are differences that make it feel much more Persona than I had originally expected. For instance, the story is incredibly prevalent and includes longer scenes as you may be used to from Persona. Weaknesses still play a massive role as well. Where I had originally expected a similar style of combat to Dynasty Warriors, I was pleasantly surprised at the tactical depth of this game; button mashing isn't going to get you very far. I would probably say it's more similar to Kingdom Hearts in that regard.\n\nAfter 40 hours, I can say I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. It's very well stylised and I am happy to be playing it on PC. That being said, I - and as far as I've seen, many others as well - have been experiencing crashes. Make sure to save at every chance you have and you shouldn't ever lose much progress. This still screams for a patch, though.\n\nBesides this, my only annoyance is that the menus are relatively slow to navigate. Again, they're very stylish, but having an animation between every sub-menu makes it a bit tedious sometimes. Could just be me, though.\n\nIn short, extremely fun game, plagued by the occasional crash. If you like both Persona and Warrior games, which I do, this is a no-brainer.",

Combat's fun, story is really good, and every single voice actor for this game put their all into their performances (especially Max Mittleman, Ryuji's voice actor, who steals the show in many parts of the game.) Truly recommend if you've played Persona 5. Play with a controller if you have one, as it just feels so much better than M+K.\n\nAlso, I've seen a few negative reviews about this game complaining about performance issues. Now either I am just REALLY lucky or some of these people have no idea what they are talking about. Silky smooth performance (locked at 60 fps granted), not a single crash my entire play through, and the only \"bug\" I encountered was some odd phrasing on an item description.\n\nAlso also, all of you folks who's reviews consist only of \"bring P5 to steam\"..... just be patient and stop whining about it ALL the time. I know a lot of people REALLY want to play this game on PC, but when you are so insistent on endlessly complaining about it, you just look really pathetic.\n\nAlso x3, this games soundtrack absolutely SLAPS.",

        "content": "A very solid game, if you're a fan of Persona 5. The game has a good narrative, that adds fun and good new characters to the universe. I would say that the story is a bit cliche but its follows the standard Persona narrative. If you have played a Persona game you most likely will know where the story is heading.\n\nI had some issues tho, the game continues Persona 5's annoying group dialogue, the group hardly gets to talk about their life's or enjoy the time and instead most of the dialogue is spent talking about the Phantom Thieves instead of something more interesting or funny. This was an issue in the last game and continues to be an issue with this game. Atlus also for some reason chooses to end the group events really quickly. I was very annoyed when this happened since it happened alot during 5, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THE GROUP AND THEY END IT SO FAST. sorry, but these choices is what makes 5's group a lot more worse than 4's and 3's since the group feels more like the Phantom Thieves instead of a friend group that you can relate to. But if you were fine with it in 5 you will feel the same way about it in this game. \n\nThere is also a lack of optional story content. Most of the optional content is done through requests, that let you go back to previous places to do different challenges to unlock things. All the characters have their own mini side request for you, and all it does is give more dialogue. I felt that this was a huge misfire, i understand not adding a huge side portion of the game, but at least give us a scene or two with these characters by ourselves, to further explore them. They have ONE scene where you get an option to pick one of the characters to go on a trip with you, that's it. Side content is one of the best parts of Persona games and with so little here it makes me a little disappointed.\n\nCombat is very fun. It is also very engaging with many different characters that open different ways to play. The only issue is that certain parts of the game are not very challenging on hard.  Again, with Persona games most of the boss battles are hit or miss, they rely on similar gimmicks to defeat them. Once you learn this gimmicks most boss battles will be finished in the first try. Combat is really fun, like i said, but it seems that because they added so many things to help your character, they really made the game less difficult in the process. \n\nAgain, Atlus does an amazing job with the visuals. The ui in this game is better than the last game, adding flashy things to the ui makes going into a menu much more cooler. The many different places you will visit on your roadtrip are very cool looking. They do a good job capturing the different looks of Japan, from the country side too how different the cities look in the different provinces. The music is also amazing, most tracks return from 5 but the battle music, the backround music, and the remixes of 5's tracks really add alot to the game.\n\n\nI had a few issues with the port. Most of my issues were with crashes during loading, for some reason i had none when in combat. Very annoying since it does not allow you to save whenever you want. \n\n\nEven with my issues with the narrative and other parts of the game, P5 Strikers is still a great experience that i think every Persona fan should play.",

        "content": "i just finished the first \"chapter\" of the game, and i have to say it's absolutely amazing. the gameplay is fun as hell, and quite in depth for a musou style game. every character has a unique gimmick to their movesets, and even joker himself has a TON of variety because of the different personas. you can end a basic combo with Triangle/Y on the controller, and depending on how many attacks you did prior, the finisher will be different, and some of them even use the equipped persona for a skill, while not using SP. this is shown the most with joker, for sure. next is the soundtrack. it's amazing. persona/SMT music has always been amazing, and this is no different. the story is great so far as well. it's just more persona 5, which i'm very much a fan of.\n\nthis game has very few cons, in my opinion at least. i've read some of the negative reviews saying the game is buggy, and borderline unplayable, and frankly that's just false. there's always going to be edge cases, but i've had almost no problems. the game has crashed twice in the about 10 hours i've played, and both times were in loading screens, not random crashes, in the middle of fights, like i've seen some reviews say. i also haven't had any major performance issues either, but i will say the game definitely runs better in exclusive fullscreen rather than borderless windowed.\n\nTL;DR\nthe game is amazing and i highly recommend it, but it does seem to crash every now and then, usually in loading screens, in my experience. the experience is overall better if you've played persona 5 first, since this is a direct sequel, but so you can definitely understand what's going on if you haven't since they provide enough context to make things make sense. but seriously, play persona 5 if you can, preferably royal, since it's way better than base P5.",

The challenge fights (Dire shadows and fratercidal shadows) are hard, but can be brute forced with items. The music is outstanding as always, and the iconic persona 5 style is present here too. Very enjoyable game all around.",

        "content": "Strikers serves as a good sequel to Persona 5. It's not perfect by any means, but it's good. It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves and takes you on a fun adventure with the thieves again. The road trip concept is really fun and you get a lot of interaction between them, though the writing doesn't feel as solid as vanilla P5 or Royal did.\n\nAs someone who's had minimum experience with the warrior series, playing Strikers was easy to get into. However, I would recommend turning off the automatic camera as soon as you can, as it made me confused playing. Also pay close attention to enemy weaknesses and abuse that as much as possible while getting combos and All Out Attacks.\n\nEarly game, try and grind out money as much as you can, upgrading the bond that raises money gain and bond exp asap. It gets easier as the game goes on but I find myself running out of money quite often if you wanna gear up your entire team at once.\n\nBeing able to pause the game to use Persona skills or items is very nice and allows you to think about your next move.\n\nThe game does feel lackluster in some areas though, most notably in dungeon length and some story elements. Some dungeons are longer than others, while a few are only floor long. They don't spend a whole lot of time on some characters or moments either and some characters feel one dimensional. But if you're just looking for a good time and wanna smash some buttons and are a fan of the Phantom Thieves, I would recommend it.",

        "content": "Summary: Gameplay is fun, a true sequel to Persona 5, but crashes, and a lack of good PC mainstay features makes it a bad purchase.\n\nHardware: \nR7 1700X \n16GB RAM\nGTX 1070\n2560x1080 75hz Monitor\n\nI have had roughly TEN crashes. The number of times this game crashes is absolutely insane.\nNot to mention, the default controls for the game are terrible with Keyboard and Mouse, making it damn near unplayable without a controller. And the keybind settings are mediocre at best.\n\nGraphical settings wise, the game lacks ultrawide support, which is a huge point against it for me personally. The game ALSO does not apparently support refresh rates above 60Hz (as modders have discovered it is apparently tied to game speed), meaning that I can't take full advantage of my 75Hz monitor. Most games also feature a way to pause when tabbed out, or to keep the game running, which P5S lacks, making some situations annoying (I.E. game pauses when I respond to a friend on discord, etc). Other than that, the game looks beautiful and I haven't had any minor or large graphical glitches yet.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that I'm able to clear up to an hours worth of content, and then the game crashes, making me replay it. Since the game is actually pretty tough on higher difficulties, and grinding isn't really a viable option, this is extremely frustrating. Until these issues are fixed, I CANNOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME. If you would like to support the Devs, purchase the game on another platform. Do NOT reward shitty ports. The game IS fun when it works, and I'd recommend it, but the state of the PC port is rather poor and I cannot personally recommend it from my experience.\n\nAlso, Atlus, please give us SMT V on PC.",

        "content": "I was a bit worried at first that this game wouldn't live up to Persona 5, and well, I shouldn't have been. This game is fun. It's a lot of fun. The combat is so much fun, it's fun to go looking for it instead of avoiding the JRPG vanilla Persona 5 which gets tiring after 100 battles of grinding. It also doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, you can ride a skateboard and run over shadows with it. You get to do realtime combat with all-out attacks, follow-ups, one-mores, technicals, persona skills/swapping, baton-passes, etc etc. It's a blast to play. I HIGHLY implore you play the game on Hard for your first run. This game NAILS hard mode so well. Unlike other games that make their higher difficulties bullshit and unfair, this game makes it fair. Not only are the enemies tougher, but so are you. You do more damage as well. Combined with dodging and countering, it makes for a super fun combat experience.\n\nThe story is pretty damn good so far too. It feels like a proper sequel to Persona 5, though any part of the game like the base game does feel a bit more empty / simplified. Keep in mind that this game is a sequel to the vanilla Persona 5, NOT ROYAL. All the characters are the same as ever and enjoyable to watch and interact with. While Confidants/Social-Links are not present, you still get to bond with your friends a good amount not only in combat but in the real-world through events; reminiscent of Persona 4.\n\nThe biggest complaint you'll probably hear from this game are the bugs. The game has this weird tendency to crash whenever you leave/enter the Metaverse. I'm unsure why. You can luckily save a lot in this game, especially right before you load a new area so it shouldn't be that much of a hindrance as long as you save. The game also has a 60fps cap and some poor Anti-Aliasing which I hope will be fixed with a patch. It's not enough to make the experience any less enjoyable, I just hope it's fixed soon because it may be more buggy depending on the hardware.\n\nOverall, very fun game. Definitely worth the price. It's around 50 hours I've seen from other playthroughs. Not too far off from the length of Persona 4. There's a good amount of fan-service here. I highly would not recommend this game if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal yet, as you probably won't have as much of an emotional connection with the characters / plot as you would with. The DLCs aren't very worth it in my opinion, unless you get them from the Deluxe version. The All-Out Attack Pack seems to be relatively worthless, while the Legacy BGM Pack is a bit pricey and only worth it if you're a big Persona fan. (Or just like Mass Destruction)",

        "content": "Persona, and Shin Megami Tensei by extension, have a pretty sizeable barrier to entry when it comes to engaging players. Turn based RPGs have their fans, but there are many people who find their gameplay loops to be unengaging. Persona 5 Strikers does an amicable job of bridging the gap, bringing classic persona tropes and mechanics to a more action oriented gameplay style. \n\nThis is no Musso/Warriors game, at least not in the same style of Hyrule Warriors or One Piece Pirate Warriors. If anything this plays more like a faster paced Kingdom Hearts game, for better and for worse. This game oozes with style, and its gameplay mechanics are just deep enough to be interesting while not going too deep into combo centric button strings. \n\nThat said, it's far from perfect. First and most glaring are the crashing issues. This game needs you to save often, and a mistimed crash can erase a good bit of effort since saving while dungeon crawling is limited to checkpoints. A saving system like this is fine, but when your game will crash without warning- it makes the checkpoint system feel less like a stopgap and more like a slight to a player who lost 40 minutes of exploring because they didn't save. \n\nBeyond that, it's a direct sequel to Persona 5, which is not available on the PC. This doesn't make the game unenjoyable to new fans, but it does throw you right back into the action assuming you know most everything about the Phantom Thieves and their six months at Shujin Academy. Despite the gameplay being a perfect way to introduce someone not usually into RPGs into Persona- the story is perhaps the exact opposite. Although for those who played 5, or at least read some wiki pages to get some backstories, the story is a fun romp across Japan with some touching moments. \n\nAll in all, Strikers is a good game. I hesitate to call it great for I believe a lot of my personal enjoyment comes from getting to see these characters again and a drive to 100% the game. Be wary of glitches and crashes- they will ruin some of the fun and you need to be prepared for that. But if you want some fun action combat drenched in Persona 5's signature style with some more of the Phantom Thieves: it's certainly going to scratch that itch for you. Whether that itch is worth scratching is up for you to decide.",

        "content": "[h1] Building up on its predecessor... [/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers (P5S) is best enjoyed if you played Persona 5 (P5) as it is best described as an amplified P5. The character quirks are more prevalent, the humour is more prevalent, many of the reused songs of P5 got more intense, and whether intentional or not the dialogue got A LOT more fellow-kiddy which only adds to the hilarity of it all.\n\nMuch of the music originates from P5 but they are complimented by just as many new songs for the new shop, activities, fights and metaverse locations so this is as solid as you would expect it with an added increased variety in music genres.\n\nFinally, while mementos do not exist anymore, the game has its own grinding mechanic affiliated with new requests awarding much more interesting rewards than the simple XP and money of memento requests of P5.\n\n\n[h1] ...yet also losing some of its original charm [/h1]\n\nThe social gameplay feels like a P5 lite with some systems absent, most notably the time management of activities, the levelling of social stats and the school in-class questions and exams. The absence of those systems also leads to a poorer diversity in world activities with shopping being the only real activity left. Even then, the majority of shopping is done in an all-in-one online shop with magic instant delivery (the game fails to provide a legitimate explanation for this although it tries to). It is a bit disheartening, but the new shop UI and song make up for it to some degree.\n\nCooking becomes a much more important part of the game, becoming more diverse and more invested with you being encouraged to scour all shops to find new recipes and ingredients and now contributes to the bond system replacing the P5 confidants.\n\nThe bond system allows for a certain level of customisation of your experience as instead of linear confidant progression, you can invest your skill points however you want, specialising in certain areas in the order that you want. \nThe bond progression is also more gameplay inclined, progressing as you play like a glorified XP bar, and while friends will give you missions to somewhat enrich their personality, those will have a much stronger \u201cRPG side quest\u201d flair to them rather than the personality or story focus of P5\u2019s confidant system.\nHowever, the gang evolves as a complete group more often and with significantly more voice acting than P5, you get to see a lot more chemistry between the different members than you did in the previous game.\n\n\n[h1] Combat, a successful conversion that stays true to its origins [/h1]\n\nMaking up for the less diverse real world, the metaverse has gotten an upgrade with a more vertical level design and Joker having gotten a lot more agile. Many more objects can be jumped on and off from but can also be interacted with in unique ways which will tie directly into combat.\n\nAnd combat is the biggest change of this game, switching from turn based to a hack and slash which is, overall, a success. Everything you learnt from P5 is still here: personas, all out attacks, knock downs, elemental affinities and weaknesses, gun special attacks and the new animations, combat sounds and of course the UI are all satisfying and switching between powers, combos and characters is as smooth as can be.\n\nThe system can feel overwhelming at first to someone new to Persona as you are being given access to the full cast of P5 right from the start which is a lot of combos and a lot of persona powers to learn.\nOnce you figure it out non-boss enemies will very quickly fall into the \"one shot combo\" area which can make the game feel a bit repetitive and/or grindy; something P5 already suffered from but P5S is at least a lot faster to switch in and out of combat.\n\nHowever, while you will be facing several dozens of enemies at once quite early on leading to a lot of visual mess (albeit good looking mess), the game remains fairly forgiving and will let you get through a few levels with simple X and RT smashing while you figure out your combos.\n\nAfterwards, the game will nevertheless throw significantly more mini-bosses your way than P5 did which makes for more interesting combat; although the danger of those mini-bosses is damaged by the leniency of the game. Indeed, saving spots have become much more abundant than they were in P5 and without the time management component, the game encourages the player to jump in and out of the metaverse to get a complete free recharge of HP and SP before teleporting back to the save spot with no downsides whatsoever, making the game devoid of resource management if one makes use of this mechanic. \n\nMaster Arts are a new system in P5S which are awarded for directly playing a character. After playing a character for a sufficient amount of time additional combos are unlocked and that amount of time is arguably too little. However, it is an interesting mechanic to reward players for sticking to a character with some additional toys.\n\nFinally, the bosses. Transforming turn-based boss mechanics into hack and slash mechanics is no easy task and P5S does not really succeed at it...or maybe it chose not to and that's a good thing.\nBosses go through different moves and phases and the ideal strategy is often to learn their sequence of action, wait for the sequence to end, exploit their weakness, and blow your combos during their break between two sequences and repeat. This is in essence a turn-based system, except you get to press the dodge button to avoid damage during the boss' \"turn\".\nIt's however not a bad system, bosses in P5 were very enjoyable and they are just as enjoyable if not more in P5S. While they get away from the hack and slash fast paced power fantasy and fall more into a the calmer strategically turn-based realm of things, this change of pace in combat approach is most welcome and still manages to capitalise on some of the new aspects of the combat.\n\n\n[h1] A great sequel yet a questionable first release [/h1]\n\nOverall P5S is a great game for people who wanted straightforward easy fun with more of the P5 characters' personalities and interactions with some extra new gameplay ideas which all work well. \nHowever, with the removal of much of what made P5 such a unique and interesting adventure, P5S fails to exceed its predecessor, although it also does not feel like it is trying to and is content with being, in essence, a high-quality expansion.\nWhile newcomers to Persona or Persona 5 might be able to enjoy P5S as a standalone, the game is unquestionably a better experience by having played the original Persona 5 which makes the release of this game on steam before a potential Persona 5 Royal port questionable at best.\n",

I personally love the implementation of Personas in combat, and think the devs did really well. It ditches most of the time-based mechanics in exchange for more combat mechanics, and I think it works.\n\nUsing a combination of fairly well-designed movement, combat, Persona interactions, and story, P5S is the game for anyone who likes Persona 5, and with realtime combat opens the game up to more people.",

CONSTANT, CRASHING. It's unbearable, I have 10 hours so far and the game has crashed 4 times. Koei Tecmo needs to get off their ass and fix this, after all this will be one of their biggest games in a while. If you have the choice between PC and another console, go console, it's much better optimized as it's already been out for a year. Im on my 3rd attempt of the Alice jail treasure securing becasue it crashed so damn much. I'm losing my patience. I wish I got this on switch instead. JUST FIX THE CRASHES AND ILL BE HAPPY",

If you plan to play this game and haven't played Persona 5 (Vanilla or Royal), this may give away some spoilers from them and you may lose context on certain things. \n\nGame is real fun. Combat is typical of Musou/Warriors games with the Persona style twist. The new characters are amazing. A several scenes alone (if you had played P5 prior) remind you why you loved Persona in the first place. \n\nOn the technical side of things. In the beginning of the game there are a few issues with audio. Mainly on the English dub end. Characters sound lower in several sections of dialogue. For example Yusuke, sounds lower than the rest of the group in the first few scenes of the game. I think that's due to the situation the English cast and crew were placed in mixing audio because of COVID\n\nSecond, some stuttering issues at 60fps on 3D cutscenes at times. I'm on windowed mode. Haven't checked at full screen and/or 30fps.\n\nThirdly, I have experienced I believe one or two crashes already. This was on windowed mode too. Luckily I wasn't too far from certain checkpoints so I didn't lose alot of progress. I recommend anyone else to continually save. \n\nGive the game a try...if you played or watched Persona 5 Vanilla and/or Royal.",

(Like you can't check side missions in palaces, so you have to get out. You can't shop from anywhere else, but from the base even though you do shopping on your phone. And you can just leave and rejoin jails to regenerate without any penalties)\n-The jails (dungeons) are just a tad bit repetatives in it's objectives.\n\nThat's it. Not the perfect game, but worth it non the less. I reccomend you to play the base game quickly (with it's 150 hours of gameplay :D) before buying this game, so the story fascinates you even more.",

I started it with the horrible experience I just explained in mind. Watching out that I would still be able to get a refund if it doesn't suit me....And what can I say? Without realizing I already player for 18 hours! :) \nI hope this encourages anyone with a similar experience to mine to give P5S a serious try. I am pretty sure you won't be disappointed!\n\nEdit: After some more playing I can call this game \"Japanese food guide 2021\" for sure. Every time I play this I get hungry AF.",

The new combat system is fun and challenging, the music is godlike as always, containing a few of my new favorite tracks from the whole series, and the whole game is as stylish as ever. The Digital Deluxe Content is also the most effort I\u00b4ve ever seen being put into a digital Artbook/Soundtrack.

But please put more effort into the next one, Sega :)",

        "content": "For someone that's never played a Persona game in my life, this one is pretty decent. The RPG hack 'n slash feels much better than the turn based gameplay that the others have, which is the only reason I bought and played this. However after 20 hours of gameplay I feel like the fun is over, the story is good to an extent, go and rescue people from being brainwashed, yada yada. But that's the extent of the story and gameplay. \n\nI also feel like the everything revolves around the gameplay rather than story. Up to the third dungeon you are doing the same thing you have been doing for the previous two, maybe it's just me but going and getting [x] but you have to do [y] before being able to do [x] three times over seems monotonous and boring. There's nothing unique that changes in the dungeons that makes those aspects better, it's just the same gameplay loop and I personally got bored of doing the same thing to go onto the same thing again, but in a different area with different enemies. \n\nAs I stated previously with the game feeling like it revolves around doing the same thing to progress the story. It would've been better for me if to progress the story you wouldn't have to do the same thing you did in the last dungeon, but it was a bit different. Instead of go to three bird cages, fight mini boss, which then allows you to fight the actual boss, there could've been other ways to lead up to the final boss fight, such as puzzles, or do some task that isn't in the metaverse that unlocks a path to [x] that helps you get to the boss. \n\nThe gameplay however is good, being able to create persona's, you have bonds/ skill tree, different characters you can play as e.t.c, it's very fun. I enjoyed playing as much as I did, but after doing the same thing for the third time, it just felt repetitive and less engaging because you already knew what you had to do,  you already knew what was going to happen. But hey, maybe that's the whole point. I just didn't enjoy that aspect.\n\n---\n\nAfter being told that the game actually gets good after the third dungeon I decided that I would give the game one last shot and well finish it, I can say for sure that I was not disappointed. Albeit what I said previously and parts of that review still holding up, the game is spectacular. Gameplay does get better after the third dungeon and it is a great story driven game, apart from spending most of it with dialogue, cut-scenes, etc. But that might just be the point of a story game. \n\nSome things I wanted to address though is the frequent random crashes and the inconsistency between cut scenes.\n\nFirstly crashes, this game has crashed *a lot* for me and when I say a lot, I mean hoping for the best the game doesn't crash when you're on the last boss fight, all items used up, 2 team mates down and hoping it doesn't just seize up and tell you \"no\". I say this because it has happened to me at the end of boss fights where you finish a boss off, goes to a white screen, then the game crashes, very infuriating and needs fixing. \n\nSecondly, the cut scenes and dialogue are just inconsistent. I don't know why it's necessary for 3 types of ways to display something happening, you have the first way of just showing it via the just dialogue bars and the characters talking, you either have to progress by clicking or having it automatically do it, then there's it being rendered in the engine and an actual cut scene AND THEN there's it being an actual animation. What. The. F*&k. There are some parts in the game where it will progress in the order and it just doesn't make sense, just show me it in one way! \n\nBut those are just some nit-picks. Great game though and introduction to the series, at least for me.",

        "content": "First of all. [h1] Hoooooo boy [/h1] Props to Omega-Force/Koei Tecmo, and P-Studio for making this game happened, and to Atlus for publishing this game to steam (praise be to Atlus). I will gladly buy any MegaTen related games.\n\nOkay so, I'll make this as concise as possible.\nThe story (although a direct continuation from the base game) is basically a reimagine of Persona 5's with a bunch of changes specifically for this spin-off. I'm just gonna say it follows the same structure, that's it (for those who have played, you'll know what I mean). It actually reminds me of the movie called HER because of how the plot heavily uses artificial intelligence as its main topic. Expect a lot of dialogue since this is still a persona game.\n\nThe gameplay is good no doubt about that, actually great. Who knew that a game that uses the combination between musou combat with persona mechanics would actually work wonders, I never thought it would be this good. Each character you control has different combat style and special ability. It's really the highlight of this spin-off.\n\nProbably the complains I have are the price and possibly, the end game content (I have my doubts on this one though) since when you finish the game, the only replayability value that this game will give you after finishing it are new game+ (you can totally 100% achievement in the 2nd playthrough) and a new difficulty. I really hope Atlus will update this game with new content, although it's unlikely to happen because this game was released in Japan a year ago and (to my knowledge) there had been no update since then.\n\nAll in all it's a good game, as expected of Atlus. Even though they really milk this series hard, you can bet the spin offs of each game are done and polished really friggin well. A definite must have for those who enjoy both persona and musou combat type of games.",

It's Showtime!\n\nBefore getting into the actual review, you should understand that this is a direct sequel to Persona 5 which is a Playstation exlusive title. \nIf you didnt play the original game or at read the manga or watched the horrible anime adaptation, you propably wont enjoy this game if you give any hsit about story. The game treats use as if you already know what happend, which is nice for people who actually do, but not for you if you have no clue whats going on. \nAlso, I think you will find it hard to care about the characters if youre not familiar with them already, since we spent over 100 hours getting to know them and their quriks, so a scene of them hanging out and having fun is propably pretty boring for somone who doesnt know them. Unless you are somone who just mashes the \"skip button\" as soon as text appears on the screen, go and play Persona 5 Royal first(improved version of P5)\n\nNow for the actual review:\nThis game is an absolute Banger. It really embodies the spirit of a sequel. The story is new and intresting while your previous knowledge is still helpful. The Dynasty Warrior gameplay combined with the Persona 5s unique style could have turned around really messy but they NAILED it! I have a lot of respect for creating a fun action RPG that still feels like Persona. You will still find yourself scrolling through your Persona skills to exploit your enemies weakness, All-out attacking and batton passing but now you can dash around and do cool combos and use your surroundings to your advantage. I think it goes wothout saying that all of this looks amazing, as expected for Persona 5. \nThere is a good mixture of new music that bangs just as hard as the first soundtrack and old tracks (remixed or not) that make the game sound familiar. \n\nThe game only crashed only once on me in 14 hours of gameplay, which really isnt a big deal. I cant imagine this game letting me down, thats why Im confident to write this review already, unless it isnt edited or deleted after I finished it, I stand by every word that I said :)\n\nGo out and steal some hearts!",

        "content": "As someone who hates JRPGs and turn based combat, playing the original game was an uphill battle for me but in the end Persona 5 still got me to play it twice totaling over 250 hours of gameplay. Persona 5 Strikers has that special feeling that got me hooked on the original and now it's also free of the turn based combat's shackles! Combat, although hectic at times, is never a chore and the story doesn't feel forced at all, everything flows perfectly! BUT if you are looking to play this game without prior experience in the Persona 5 universe i think it might become a bit confusing and little too much to handle, at the opening hours especially. As the game's treated not like a new entry but entirely like a sequel to the original.",

        "content": "It's definitely not going to be the most enjoyment you get out of a persona game, but it's a decent game overall. However, their are a few issues on PC that just are saddening. The Default controls are AWFUL. they're really bad, so I recommend using a controller, or changing them. I decided to play with a keyboard just to get the default experience. Their is a lack of multiple aspects from the original persona 5 that I wish were here, but this is a spin off game after all. The game plays well enough, their is a few minor odd things that happen (that may happen on console as well) but it isn't anything game breaking. The one thing that really makes me upset is when I alt tab, and go back into the game the dodge button (alt) will start making windows noises if you press it over and over again. (and you'll basically be using dodge alot). I hope to see more persona ports on steam! These games are great, and I'd love nothing more than to play them here, even if their are issues. I just hope some of this stuff gets patched out, or fixed in some way shape or form, and I want to look forward to some nice ports in the future!",

If you have played it though, this game is a very intriguing new story that takes place afterwards. It's awesome to have the gang back together for another adventure!",

I played Persona 4 shortly after it released on PS2, Persona 4 Golden when it ported to PC and of course P5 and P5 royal on PS4. They\u2019re all amazing games that all fall within the same idea of combat, time management and Social links, but for some reason atlus decided to make this one a hack and slash. The combat feels mashy and brainless compared to what I would expect from a Persona/SMT game. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that it\u2019s a great game within its genre but the style of combat turned my immeasurable hype into disappointment. It just doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nEdit: \nI want to point out that when I wrote this review I had 1.5 hrs and the game had crashed once, regarding it as an anomaly. I thought perhaps I was being rash and gave the game some more time. I stand by all I previously said. Additionally the game crashed a further 3 times forcing me to replay the same scenes over and over.",

There are less personas in general in the compendium to collect but still has like 60+ so not that bad.\n\nNot sure how long this game will be, at my current time it feels like I still have a long ways to go and won't be reaching the end anytime soon so expect somewhat of a long game going in which is all the much better if you ask me",

        "content": "*IMPORTANT* \nThis game crashes ALOT, at the worst time possible. I'm not sure why; to make things worse, the checkpoints to save the game are quite far in between so uhh, the anxiety of hoping the game won't crash while you're far away from a save point is stressful. So if you're playing, remember to save as many times as possible. Redoing what you did from the past 3 hours is not fun. \n\nAnyways, Persona 5 Strikers is a nice sequel for fans of Persona 5 (Royal). However, the combat is a musou-type game, being completely different from Persona 5's turn based combat. Although, it is very interesting to see how they incorporated hack and slash with the tactical use of personas & baton passes.\n\nThe overworld exploration is satisfying, being able to walk around Shibuya, Sapporo, Osaka, and so on with your pals is a nice feeling. \n\nOne thing to note is how the new Velvet Room functions. With the removal of social links, you can't get bonus exp for your personas from social links. Instead you can level up your personas through the use of PPs (Persona Points) which is a little disappointing but it's fine.\n\nTo further explain on the removal of social links, Persona 5 Strikers introduces a mechanic called Bonds to replace it. With bonds, you may unlock certain bonus perks like \"Extra Money Dropped Per Battle\" & so on. You can get bond points from playing through the game.\n\nIt's a game to play if you're interested to see what's up with the Phantom Friends after the first game. Not so for the depth of the combat/gameplay, Persona 5 (Royal) still triumphs on that part. \n\nSome mechanics from the first game were revamped or changed to be better/worse. It's up to you to make your own opinion on it.",

        "content": "A great sequel to the one of my favourite games Persona 5! The characters are just as you left them with all their character development still intact! The combat seemed to translate really well into the warriors style and it was easy to understand and get into into the groove of the way it all works. If you are a fan of Persona 5 and just wanted more of the characters and a good continuation of the story i think you'll find a game that you love right here!",

        "content": "As a hack and slash enthusiast, I knew I had to buy this game. I had no previous experience with any Persona or Shin Megami Tensei media, but I believe this might change. Anyhow, the combat system is surprisingly very satisfying. Sure, it does not have the complexity of DMC5 or the absolute fluidity and smoothness of the original Bayonetta. However, it does not take away from the core hack and slash experience, in fact, the combo system reminds me a bit of how combos are handled in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance as you can, in theory, keep comboing endlessly, granted you don't get staggered, which, to me, is somewhat satisfying.\n\nOverall, it's a 9/10 game for me.",

I would say that this is a great spinoff of the original P5 and it is really a great game for fans.\n\nAfter the boss fight the game crashes suddenly without saving, and there are really a lot of crashes.\nI hope whoever has brought the port to PC will really fix the problem.\n\nThe game itself resembles the structure of P5 (not p5r) and while it is Persona enough, I wouldn't really consider it a game that is worth the full price tag. Also, while the combat is a great combination of real-time combat and the traditional P5 skills, I do think think that it is somewhat too flashy. \nIf you have played P5 before, you can easily tell the similarity and the parallel structure, and I would say that P5S is really an attempt to use the same structure to tell a somewhat different story. It has the core of the later part of P5R and the narrative structure of original P5.\n\nGreat music, great artwork, great Japanese VA. There are no complaints about the game itself beside the crashes. It is a solid game when on sale, and the price tag is not fully justified with its current length.\n\nOverall, I would give it s 8/10. Solid for P5 fans, but not so worth the full price otherwise.",

Feels slightly different compared to other Persona games (ex. no social links), but overall is an amazing sequel to Persona 5. Highly recommend playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game as multiple references are made to the original. However, keep in mind the P5R endings are non-canon (as far as I'm aware) and therefore no P5R-exclusive characters like Kasumi or Maruki are in this game.",

Especially since none of the conversation seems interesting. Like listening to teenagers talk disappointing since i played the first as a child. If you like where ff15 went you may like this same principle, i personally started out on ff1 for nintendo and hated 15 as most everything that made it feel like a rpg was gone for me. This feels the same. Its actually one of the few final fantasy i never did/wanted to finish. I get the feeling this will be the same unless it picks up.  I hate that rpgs are trying to turn into hack and slash. If i wanted a hack and slash which i occasionally do ill go play a dynasty warrior which doesnt eat up most of your time with talking. (i am updating the review with my below comments as i play more)",

This game is perfect for those who want more persona 5 story, music, funny moments, and fun gameplay. This game is definitely a 10/10.

The review is mostly semantic - Persona stans have already bought it, and if you aren't part of the crew yet this might be a weird place to jump in. For what it's worth, the game is respectful of spoilers to the previous game, and was made before Royal so you're safe there, but you probably want to wait for P5R to get ported to PC before diving in. \n\nAnd Atlus, I'm ready to throw money at a Sophia figure whenever you're ready to make one.

The story is a typical Persona story, fullu wholesome with some twists that you see coming a mile away, but awesome nonetheless.\n\nIf you liked the original Persona 5, or Royal even though this game never mentions anything from that, then this is a wonderful continuation of the story and I cannot recommend it enough.\n",

While the Dynasty Warriors gameplay may be generic or old to some, to me, its something I played when i was really young so its something very special to me no matter how generic it may be. \nThe characters here feel the same as what they did in Persona 5 though a little more mature but still making them more unique from one another like Yusuke and Ryuji. Now that my previous problem is gone, I can now continue playing this game to the finale.",

Could be im a huge Dynasty warriors fan and love their music too, but Atlus and Koei music is absolutely jaw-dropping to me. The combat meshes persona and warriors mechanics well and it really does feel like another reunion with your friends through the story. 20 out of 10 Atlus keep giving me moooooore\n\nedit: after 30 some more hours into I come to the conclusion the game is still great but the request system couldnt have been done by atlus, it is awful. forced stealth is always obnoxious, especially when a spotlight clips you and you have to leave the entire jail, re-enter the RV, re-select the quest, go back into the jail, and do it again without using checkpoints. It's not necessarily difficult as it is backtracky, boring and obnoxious. They give you 8-15 requests at a time, you can only have 8. The main bit is having to leave the jail, enter the rv, jail select, jail, every. single. time.",

        "content": "Spoiler Free!\n\n-Story: This is basically Persona 5-2. The story is a direct continuation of P5, and so if you haven't played the first one, you'll definitely be lost in this game. The writing quality is on par with if not better than the original. \n-Characters: There are some points where the original Phantom Thieves feel exaggerated, but for the most part they're very strong. Not nearly as flanderized as previous Persona spin offs. The new cast members are excellent additions. It's impressive that even with 10-ish characters, no one feels left out of the story. Also Haru got her screen time.\n-Gameplay: The combat is simple enough to get into, but has enough elements to make fights feel like more than just button mashing. Weaknesses, One Mores, Environment attacks, etc. all help keep you thinking about how to attack.\n\nAside from a few nitpicks here and there, I would say this game is excellent. Very fun combat and a great sequel story. The main limiting factor is if you haven't played P5. If you haven't played it, I wouldn't recommend this game. The combat is fun, but it's not enough to sell the game if you're not also interested in the story. Play P5 first so you'll understand these characters and what they're talking about when they mention past events.\n",

        "content": "Not as content-rich as Persona 5 Royal, or even the original Persona 5, which is frankly to be expected with a spinoff. The roster of available personas is rather small, the game basically tells you what to do and prevents you from doing anything else, and the social link/confidant system present in the main series is replaced with a watered-down bond system. However, the flair of Persona 5 remains, and it's very flashy, especially with the hack-and-slash gameplay. All-Out Attacks, Showtimes, and the series's signature \"persona eyes\" all add to this game's style, without the need for much graphical power, allowing this game to run on lower-end or older gaming PCs. Fair warning: the plot will not make a lot of sense without the context of Persona 5. As I do not have a PS4, I watched a let's play of the game instead (I am told the anime sucks). If you have a PS4, or are one of the lucky ones to get your hands on a PS5, I recommend you play Persona 5/P5R first, otherwise you won't have context. It is unfortunate that P5 or P5R are unavailable on Steam, but it is understandable if Atlus signed an exclusivity agreement with Sony. Overall, If you enjoyed Persona 5, you will likely enjoy this, and I recommend the digital deluxe edition, since for $10 more, you get $15 worth of DLC in addition to exclusive bonus content.",

However, do not make the mistake I did of trying to play it with mouse and keyboard. I typically prefer to play everything m+kb, but this game made me switch. Even after rebinding all the keys, the combat is still a nightmare on keyboard. It's very fast paced, so I always hit the wrong buttons, it's difficult to do follow up attacks and showtimes, and switching characters is way more effort than it needs to be. It's playable with m+kb but the experience was infinitely better when I switched to a controller. I'm sure people can do it, but I would recommend using a controller.",

        "content": "This review is from someone who also played the original Persona 5 game as well as P5 Royal.\nIt's good for what it is, which is a game in the genre of Dynasty Warriors. In my opinion it is best played on the harder difficulty. That being said for some fans of the Persona series who played and loved P5 and Royal, this might be a bit disappointing. It feels like a slightly gutted version of P5 unfortunately.\n\nThere isn't really any sort of Social Link/Confidante mechanic. As such there's zero instance of the archana system for fusing Personas and the strategy behind it. There is also no real time constraints like in P5/R (which might be very welcome to a lot of people, I get it). For me, those were some of my favorite aspects of P5/R as it allowed you to really get to know the various stories of many great characters.\n\nThe game's story so far is enjoyable though, having taking place I think half a year after P5/R. There is no canon choice for things like romances, Royal's characters, etc. The style is still there and amazing as always in the new and changed environments and characters. The soundtrack is great like usual.\n\nAll this being said, even though I'm disappointed in some aspects of the game, it's still very enjoyable so far for the genre it's in. I don't usually care for Dynasty Warrior-type of games. If I had to give it an arbitrary rating out of 10, it'd be a 6 or 7 out of 10.",

        "content": "A fantastic game and a brilliant followup to Persona 5. By far the best Persona spinoff we've had yet.\n\nThe fusion of Persona with Warrior style gameplay works great, the presentation genuinely makes you feel like you're playing a mainline title, except it's an Action RPG instead of a Turn-based one.\n\nThe story is very similar to Persona 5's, but with enough differences and additions to make it feel like a fresh experience. Definitely not as deep as some other Persona stories, but still a good one.\n\nI played on Hard difficulty, and battles rarely felt \"tedious\" or \"boring\" like a lot of people often accuse Warrior games of being (the only real exceptions being some optional bosses which act a little too much like HP sponges for my liking). I did find the difficulty jumped around a bit for certain bosses, where the boss of the semi-final dungeon was brutal to defeat, yet the final boss itself was a complete joke.\n\nThe music is, as you'd expect from a Persona game, absolutely fantastic. Lyn Inaizumi returns to sing for an almost entirely new soundtrack, as well as doing some Warrior's style \"Rock\" remixes of Persona 5 music (\"Last Surprise\" and \"Rivers in the Desert\").\n\nThe graphics aren't exactly stellar or anything, but they work well enough for what the game is going for (considering this games is also on the Switch). The art direction is as amazing a P5's was.\n\nApart from some HP sponge bosses and some occasionally crusty visuals, my only other complaint with this specific port is that I experienced quite a few crashes while playing. These usually occurred after long play sessions and weren't super often or anything, but still very annoying when they occurred and can potentially lose you a lot of unsaved progress.\n\nI'd also say I'd HEAVILY recommend playing the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this, as there's numerous characters and references to them that first time Persona fans wouldn't understand.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a solid 8/10. It's fantastic experience that Persona 5 fans will love, despite some difficulty and crashing issues. I hope we start seeing more Persona games being ported to other platforms now, specifically Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 FES (hopefully a remake for the latter!).",

If you're afraid that it's your typical Musou game, I'm telling you that it's not as it retains all the battle mechanics that originated from the main games; weaknesses, buffing/healing and even min-maxing your Personas in the Velvet Room to their highest capabilities. I recommend not getting it if you're new to the Persona 5 story as the it takes place right after the main games and this won't be the \"authentic Persona experience\" if you're looking to get into the franchise. All in all, it's a fantastic game. Here's hoping Persona 5 Royal will be released on Steam!",

        "content": "Some tips for new players:\n- Save your SP. And buy the SP recovery item every instant you can. \n- Go into jail then leave it let you reset the vendor items. So you can use this to stocking your Healing/SP Recovery Items. Cooking Ingredient also.\n- Combo let you use persona skills without spending SP. It's weaker but it'll save you alot of SP.\n- All teammate have their uses, But Sophia & Haru is highly recommend from how good they are. ( Just don't use Haru first boss ) \n\n\nThere're many downside for a console main game publisher/developer to be try out on PC, but i am truly welcome it. For i am a fan of Persona series for 10 years. Hoping for more Persona game to be release on PC.\nAfter 50 hours, i still want to play more and waiting for more things to unlock. It's a musou-like game, but is it felt like one? To be honest, no. I actually love the battle system more than vanilla P5. Despite being a fan of the combat system of Persona, it just hit me right to see your favorite characters combat in real time with flashy and REALLY EXTRA moves. I'm all about that extra moves.\nBut.\nThere're downside that i'm hope Atlus can fix and improve, i love the game, but it NEED TO BE IMPROVE.\n\n- Anti-alias is a joke.\n- Horrible basic keybinds. I change it the instant i am possible to. I don't blame them for how this is one of the first game they port to PC ( P4G don't have real time combat so the keybind don't affect this much and it quite alright. )\n- The game will crash from time to time, I crashed like 4 times in the past 4 days while in loading. Sometimes it could be truly horrible for how you're not saved after finish all request and going to the fight the Jail Boss. Cause we have to do it in one sitting. PLEASE FIX IT !\n\nI'll rate it for now, 7/10. If they can fix those that i said i would totally give it a solid 8-8.5/10\n\nPLEASE GIVE US DLC ! I buy the game pre-release full price AND I STILL WANT TO PAY MORE TO GET THE SKINS AND PERSONA. :( It's been a year of japan release but i still truly hoping for it.",

        "content": "Following Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5 Strikers comes to Steam with everyone including me who has played the original Persona 5 crying for joy. P5S continues the story of the original Persona 5 game based on where it's left off but has a twist that none of it's predecessors saw coming. It plays in a Musou fashion where you smack and annihilate enemies in real time combat. It borrows the same concept as Persona 5 where you can use your skills in the midst of combat. Being in constant 60 FPS, the game runs smoothly and feels natural to the touch. The story and voice acting is as superb as usual and it doesn't stray far from the original Persona 5 despite being a different type of game. To Atlus, Don't be afraid to release the other Persona games onto Steam. Many people look forward to it for multiple reasons such as not owning the specified console or in this case, introduces a lot of newcomers into the series. Persona 5 Strikers is definitely a game that's going to do very well so as for other future games that's to come.",

Characters, like the friends of the protagonist, are mainly there just to serve as gameplay pawns. They don't have many meaningful conversations or social events like in the main games. You cannot talk to very many NPCs and the different locations serve just as backdrops. So you strip away everything Persona games* are known for and what you're left with is... a hack and slash grind that doesn't even offer the risk and reward of Persona's time limited dungeons.\n\nI was actually planning to get further in the game before posting my review, but then I lost a hefty amount of progress because the game crashed. So I also recommend you take a look at the community discussions to see how many people are having issues with the port, random crashes seem to be really common.\n\nIt's not an awful game per se, it's just mediocre at best. If you need more of the Phantom Thieves and you're fine with the hack and slash type gameplay, then go for it.\n\n* = at least the newer ones",

        "content": "Fans of P5S will dig so much about this from the rejoining of some great characters, music from P5 and other Persona games, and re-exploring the themes and ideas that we found so interesting that we didn't just put 100 hours into P5, we put another 130 into P5R. However, I can't recommend this game because I just don't think it's very good on its own. I will probably play it to completion, but not because I think it's actually worth my time.\n\nThere's a scene early on where the old crew goes to the old hangout at their school and one comments about how it hasn't been that long, but they still feel a sense of nostalgia and I think that sentiment just about sums it up. I enjoy P5S only so much in that it reminds me of a game I rather enjoyed more and would likely have more fun replaying than honoring it in a sequel/spinnoff. P5S is weaker in just about every way. The story is rushed, the villains lack any depth, there is no buildup to the events that occur, and both dungeon crawling and combat have baffling design choices.\n\nKoei Techmo appear to have sort of mashed the Dynasty Warrior and Persona engines together, though one is custom and the other based on Unity. Combat plays like a DW game, but you are a team of four and enemies have the abilities and effects of Persona, at least for the most part, and theoretically this should work. One problem is that all the magic is range-based and so if you're attacked, it's usually from off-screen, and even weak enemies can have powerful effects. I spent an hour on one encounter because I had to fight alone and Pixies kept casting zio (lightning bolt) which caused stun and the duration was long enough for other enemies to punch me from full health to zero. I eventually learned that hit and run is the only way to survive.\n\nI am not a DW fan, but the combat just doesn't feel right in other ways, too. The camera is slow, controls sluggish, visuals to chaotic to be easily readable while being swarmed, you deal very little damage, and you're constantly switching between different characters with different control priorities and play styles. This could work if switching were seamless like Marvel vs Capcom, but it's not, or if each character was deep like and interesting enough for their own game like DMC5, which they aren't. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to say the combat is terrible, it's just not great. It's not a refinement of a good idea, nor a remarkable innovation. Okay, passable, not great.\n\nDungeon crawling is passable, functioning like in P5 with pseudo-stealth mechanics and platforming, though is mostly held back by long load times, even on my SSD. Whenever you find a checkpoint, you should leave the dungeon to heal up and immediately return and the only reason you won't is the loading screen on exit and reentry, even though each scene is fairly small and constantly reuses assets. This almost feels intentional because otherwise they could have made checkpoints heal you and you'd never have reason to leave the dungeon.\n\nFinally, the story: I won't go into what it's about too much because I routinely finding myself lose focus as dialogue flies by without developing much. The story is a thin wrapper around finding excuses to throw the team into dungeons and go on a road trip to find more dungeons. Learn that bad person exists, go to their dungeon, get blocked, defeat a mini boss, go back and defeat the real boss. Same formula as P5, just a lot more trimmed down. It also all takes place over a summer vacation road trip so you don't have any worries aside from someone being a bad person.\n\nVerdict: P5S is a toned down imitation of P5 that at times feels lovingly crafted, but mostly just a cynical cash grab made for fans and only fans.",

Additionally, the anti-aliasing seems to be broken and aggressively blurs the text and ui elements, meaning that if you want the models to look nice you need to either run a third party aa solution, or (as I did) run the game in 4K, which is pretty easy to do (because P5 is a PS3 game).",

So far it hasn't happened after a lot of gameplay, just a lot of the VN portion (which is easy to speed through), but it is notable and needs to be fixed. For the record, I do recommend this game, I would just hold off until they release a patch for this.\n\nEdit: They didn't fix the crashing issue but holy shit it's too good to not play. I personally liked the story even more than Persona 5. The game being shorter only serves to benefit it, really. The story feels a lot less drawn out at parts, and there's very little filler. What filler there is, is heartwarming fun with the friend group you wish you had.",

As someone who generally prefers turn based RPG combat, I have to say that playing this more real time action combat was a nice change of pace and generally a great time. The characters are as lovable as ever, the story is gripping and intriguing, the soundtrack and art is absolutely phenomenal, and the game play is a total blast. I would absolutely recommend picking up this game, it's well worth the price, and if you're a fan of the Persona series or action RPGs, I can almost guarantee you'll love it.",

But if you have played, then this is a great game to continue the story. \n\ncombat is a bit different obviously but it is not welcomed. theres still the hack and slash element (which is ok but for me can get tedious) but the persona element that made combat interesting in the previous P5 titles does the same for this combat style. in my opinion, it makes the combat that much more interesting to me. combine that with combos that differ from each character, i defintely am a fan of this style of hack and slash combat style.\n\nonly cons that ive found is that you dont see many characters from the previous game (which i get because this is technically a brand new game but come on, we get to walk around town a bit, i wanna see some old faces!) and dialog is pretty linear which is everyone's main complaint im sure (i just want to romance Makoto again - big sad). but other than that, the story is interesting and the new characters are as well!\n\nanyone who buys the game, the only recommendations is git gud at the dodge mechanic and really play into to weaknesses of the enemies. do that and you should be golden!",

        "content": "  Seeing the Phantom Thieves back in action is something I wouldn't expect for the Persona series, being the first to have another adventure with the same group of characters just makes me happy to experience all the moments of the group of friends from the last game.  Besides all that I enjoyed the different kind of combat that I haven't experience for a Persona game, since I have played Hyrule Warriors before I must say I enjoyed Persona 5 Strikers more since it had all the battle mechanics like all the other Persona games.  The music, I absolutely enjoyed the new tracks, even with the original Persona 5 sound tack made it feel so nostalgic, even adding past games was also nice to randomize the tracks for every battle you get into.  Anyways I loved the game!  even though it took me 5 days to complete!",

        "content": "[h1] Persona 5 Strikers completed review [/h1]\n\n[h1] Disclaimer [/h1]\nThis is not a spin-off of Persona 5, this is a sequel. For any newcomers on Steam looking to enter the Persona series, I do not recommend this game as an entry point. The game assumes that you've played Persona 5 and understand the group's dynamics and past because it does not explain it to you and constantly references the OG Persona 5 game. So this is a review of Strikers from a fan of Persona 5 instead of a newcomer.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe Phantom Thieves goes on a trip around Japan! Strikers does a great job in giving the player more group interactions and is also an excellent tourism advertisement for Japan. Not much to say here without spoiling the story, but any Persona fan who wants to see more Phantom Thieves will get their money's worth.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the part you're probably looking for. The collaboration between Omega Force and P-Studio brings the Warriors gameplay to Strikers. However, unlike Hyrule Warriors, this game does not utilize the same overall gameplay as the Warriors series. You will not be going around a big map fighting generals with your army. Instead, Strikers plays [b] exactly [/b] like Persona 5, but it's now an Action RPG. You navigate the map similar to Persona 5, slowly approaching enemies to ambush them. Using Personas, you target weakness to down your enemies and execute an All-Out Attack. Show Time also makes its return from Royal. This core gameplay loop will be familiar but now it's cooler and more fast-paced because it has action elements in it. If you love the gameplay in Persona 5, you won't have a problem here.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nBecause it's an Action game now, the Strikers remixes have more electric guitars in it and sounds 10x more energetic. It's amazing. I'm listening to it on repeat already. If you love the Persona 5 OST, you can add the new songs into your playlist and jam out even more.\n\n[h1] PC Port [/h1]\nThe PC port is pretty average. Nothing significant to note of its settings; it's the same settings you expect from a typical PC game. The game also caps at 60fps, so no unlimited/120/144 fps. One important thing to note is that this game does experience some random crashes when loading a new area/going into another menu, based on mine and my friends' experiences. Save often to ensure you don't lose much progress when one does eventually happen.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis is definitely a game you will want to play as a Persona 5 fan. By no means is this some insignificant spin-off, it's a sequel that Persona fans will want to play like how Royal is. I'm happy that Atlus (probably with help from KT and Omega Force) decided to put this game on PC and I hope that it's a continuous sign of more Persona games coming to PC. Also, after finishing this game, if this game gave ideas to P-Studio to make future games as Action RPGs, I'm [b] all for it [/b]. HEE-HO!",

I am not a fan of the dynasty warriors type of game play usually, however this game re-imagines that concept with the different characters and abilities in a way similar to Hyrule Warriors. The story and characters are just as lovable as they are in Persona 5. A small issue that many people have with this game is the lack of social links and confidants seen in previous entries in the series, but this game makes up for it in its fast game play. This game is not the same game as Persona 5, it's its own game. The fact that you can exit and re-enter the jail to fully replenish your health and sp on the same day without being forced to sleep is a great part of this game and the jails are absolutely massive. You're given access to almost all the characters right out of the gate and introduced to both of the new members of the group very quickly. At the moment, I am close to completing the first jail and am thoroughly enjoying the fights and have yet to feel the fights as tedious. The boss fights are especially fun as they require you to use a little bit more strategy instead of just spamming X X X X X Y. \nOverall at the moment, I give this game my rating of a:\n8.5/10",

Only so you get a better understanding of the story, at first seeing Persona become a \"Hack 'n' Slash\" I wasn't very interested but shit the game is really good no less!",

If you don't play that one first, the story won't make sense, therefore it's pretty much needed for a narrative-driven game like this. From the music to the menu panels, the game exudes elegance, and it's a lot of joy to play. The unlocks and skill growth are satisfying, and the side tasks are realistic. It's even faster-paced than its predecessor, cramming in nearly all of the plot beats in approximately a third of the time, which is very pleasant.",

If Strikers stays as strong as it is at the beginning through the whole game then it might just pass P4D as my favorite spinoff in the series. The combat is amazing thanks to those at Omega Force and while Musou games typically lack soul,  P5S does not because P-Studio and Atlus were in charge of the story.",

        "content": "For any Persona fan, this is a must-play. Even if it's on Easy so you can random-button-mash the combat, it's worth it just for the story alone! This is a direct sequel to the original Persona 5 (not the Royal expansion), and it takes place a year later. The music, as usual, is fantastic from the moment it starts, and jumping back into this world feels like reuniting with an old friend! \n\nI'm an avid mouse & keyboard gamer but I would definitely recommend connecting a controller for this game. I used a PS4 controller and it was extremely easy and streamlined, just plug it into the computer with a micro USB cable and you're ready! The game switches seamlessly between mouse/keyboard and controller input & display depending on the last input it detects.\n\n60fps Persona is a dream; this and the P4G PC release are both proof that this game series deserves simultaneous PC releases from here on. One downside right now (as of 2/23/21 at 10:52PM) is I've had a handful of crashes, usually on loading screens. Be sure to save frequently!\n\nIf you're not a Persona fan because you hate fun or you have bad taste, then this game might not be for you..,",

I've had one Crash to Desktop after a save, thankfully it loaded me into the next cutscene when I loaded it back up, and sometimes the background music breaks up a bit. Other then that, it's a decent Warror's Lite game that I would say is actually more Persona instead of Warriors to the point I can actually tolerate it a lot more then a traditional Warriors knockoff game.\n\nEDIT: By the time I finished the game at 45 and a half hours with no real grinding, I had a second CtD that occurred under similar circumstances as the first time. Game had a lot more content in it then I was expecting and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I hope we get some actual DLC for this game down the road! Oh I had also played with Borderless Window on a TI 1080 card.",

        "content": "Things to do before playing: Play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game, trust me the game is better knowing the events of Persona 5.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStory: Amazing, always had me engaged, but at times it dragged on with Jail Scenes and made the game feel a bit slow at time because of it, but not too much of a gripe to be too mad about.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay: Addicting and makes want to keep playing. You will struggle with this game if you button mash, which I like. It \nmakes you learn when to use certain skills and when to use just the character's base attacks.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReplay Value: Great replay value for 100% completionist and people who want to do Merciless Difficulty. (i'm doing that rn and it's really fun so far! Just make sure you prepare for it before going in.)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPost-Game: Persona 5 Strikers can offer around 5-10 hours of post game content before NG+ is unlocked, and I actually really like it, it gave me something to do even after you beat the Final Boss. The post game can challenge your skills with the game so far and really put you up to test with some of the content they give you during post-game.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPC Port: This PC port is not great at all, through out my 55+ hours of this game, the game crashed many times and even set me back 3 hours one time. It could've been much much worse, but could've been so much better. I think Atlus should work on this field alot more in upcoming PC Ports of their games.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion: Persona 5 Strikers is a great sequel to Persona 5 and continues great story telling even if feeling slow at times with some pacing issues in the Jails. It also offer a lot after you beat the game like, a new difficulty, Merciless, a Post-Game that keeps you playing and improving your abilities, and overall is a great experience for those who have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. (Atlus port these please)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScore: 8.5/10",

        "content": "I didn't expect the sequel to Persona 5 could turn out so well to be released as an ARPG given the long-standing tradition of the series under a turn-based framework. In all honesty, I bought this 'because it's Persona' given the usual depth and excellence in storytelling among the franchise, and the combat system surpassed my expectation of it being 'yet another Dynasty Warrior reskin but with a thrilling and compelling story instead of exaggerating magical power under a historical framework'. This adds up to my faith in the studio alongside the pre-sequel, my favorite JRPG. Amazing work there Atlus. \n\nMechanics-wise, what I admire the most is the smooth systemic incorporation of the inheritance from P5 under a new concept. It isn't like the Pokemon anime when the pikachu that could lead you to championship would turn into a lv5 noob just because the protagonist has entered a new zone. You face crowds of shadows here and there are real challenges in combat which could be entertaining - your build does matter here and it does not just take time to level up to wreck everything. Upon my first engagement in this game I was already advised to make good use of the environment, and this is totally true and essential in beating the game. You also cannot just lead your foes altogether and clear them up at once - the weakness system from P5 is still a significant factor to consider in engagement. The old and the new does not crash against each other but serve as complements to each other, this is unbelievably well-done. \n\nI am still first starting off with the game (6.7 hours of playtime upon the 1st day of purchase, and yes i have a proper day job) and on my way beating the first Jail, but I can see how well-thought-out the designers (and all the staff related to the development of this title) are in making the game already. \n\nI like Divinity: Original Sin 2 a lot and I have been considering it my favorite game of all times. I would say that Persona 5 Strikers is on par with the depth of DOS II but of another genre under the umbrella term of RPG, that it offers a distinctively different taste as an ARPG. Persona 5 Strikers features both active fast-paced combat and a youthful and engaging story while DOS II offers an interactive complex turn-based system and tells an exquisitely crafted tale. I know that they are completely different and go by different directions, but they are both ultimately guiding you through a thought-provoking and interesting universe.\n\nAdditional note: \nSpeaking of such, in my opinion it definitely reaches the level of NieR: Automata when it comes to the actions and controls, but the styles direct them to different kinds of audience. If you somehow feel like your young blood is boiling, this would be for you while NieR: Automata is to let you rethink what you want to do as an entity.",

        "content": "[b]Show me your true form![/b]\n\nGreat game so far, kind of weird playing a Persona game that isn't turn based. There were some minor issues upon first launching it but they disappeared after restarting. The default key bindings are also very disgusting, definitely change them before starting the game as you can not change them while playing on a save :/ I ended up locking myself in the tutorial mission because I had \"gun\" assigned to Tab and \"lock-on\" assigned to Alt...yeah you can probably see the problem there.\n\nOther than that, just like every Persona game the characters/soundtrack/story are amazing! It's a lot of fun being able to play as other characters aside from Joker. There's a fuck ton of new mechanics in this game compared to all the previous games so you will have plenty to do/work on.\n\nHowever...from what I heard there is one major downside to this game...[b]why can I not romance best girl Makoto?? or any character for that matter?[/b]",

Admittedly, I'm not a fan of Koei Tecmo gameplay, but there's not much I wouldn't do for some more Persona 5.\nOne primary gripe so far is the need of tactical decisions in the middle of fast-paced action. It might have helped to incorporate less from Persona 5's battle system, as I feel managing afflictions and elemental weakness doesn't really work well in this gameplay.\nMy other gripe is that Sophia is just weird looking.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone wanting some more Persona 5.",

        "content": "I'm just under 9 hours into the game and so far I'm hooked. The first four hours does a good job recapping the story for those with a passing familiarity with the story of Persona 5 (for best results play P5). It seems to I'd say all you need to know going into the story though is their general character types and that they're friends. The game mentions pretty explicitly other parts through this game's Sophie. Who wasn't in P5 and has to have things explained to her.\n\nPros:\nExcellent bit of nostalgia pandering in the beginning. It's been around 5 years since the last time I played P5 and played P5R as a light recap. So it was a nice reunion at the beginning.\n\nMusic is fucking orgasmic. P5 is by far the best music wise in the series that I've played and the only one I blast on my radio in my car on the way to work. The mixing is perfect too. It highlights the scene well without crowding the emotional scenes.\n\nThe first jail is long enough that you get a feel for how it's going to be playing the game going forward. It introduces a lot of new features as well as removing some too. For example, you can exit a Jail at any time and it won't advance time until you hit a certain story point. This mechanic is balanced by refreshing the items and enemies in the area, so it's possible to grind more effectively for certain types of items. They also took away the ability to use any corner or large object as cover making it harder to get ambush encounters.\n\nNot many bugs. I'm sure there are bugs to be found as in every game out there, but with this one it's possible to play the game as intended and not encounter a single bug.\n\n\nCons:\n\nThere are parts of the jails that seem built to pad the time you're spent in there. Instead of introducing a new puzzle for you to solve they will throw something at you immediately after throwing it at you for the first time. (Light spoilers for the first jail) there's a section where you're made to walk along a series of tight ropes to activate a pannel, then you have to back track and activate three generators in an area you've already been and that takes a while to get back and forth through.\n\nStory segments are significantly longer than in the other two games. The first twenty minutes are almost nothing but cutscenes and at the end there is a section where you transition from the opening to the actual game that hangs for a while and if you click away it seems to crash the game for most PC users. This is made particularly annoying by the fact that the first opportunity to save isn't for the first 30 minutes.\n\nThe on-screen information is a bit lacking. The problem with the eye-popping style of P5 is that eventually all the eye-popping information blends into the background. This system worked when the battles were turn based, and you could take your time and read it all. But Now that the action is real-time it makes it really hard to tell at a glance what information you need. Is Ryuji about to die or just low SP? \n\nHow the hell do I hear Mona saying it's time for a showtime attack when he barely speaks above the level of the battle sounds? And the notifier is the two buttons flashing below your health, but you have eight enemies stun-locking you into oblivion while you desperately mash dodge. That's not to say I hate the new system it's just not P5's battles and if you go into it expecting something similar then you'll be disappointed.\n\nConclusion:\nThat's about all I have. It's a mixed bag of fresh new things and the same old things you enjoyed about the older games. It looks like it's going to be a really good game from what I can see. I can't wait to see where it ends up.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a pile of trash that attempts to cash in on the Persona branding while ignoring pretty much everything that made Persona 5 what it is. \n\nAllow me to explain. Strikers has a very strange sense of 'balance', where most random encounters can be solved in a single hit by ambushing the enemy and immediately going into an all-out attack that just clears the screen. About the only time you'll ever get hit is if you don't pull off an ambush - which is common because the \"ambush\" button is the same as the \"power attack\" button and so half the time you'll wind up shooting the enemy instead of ambushing. You also more or less lose the ability to ambush enemies from behind: you pretty much have to be in a hiding spot and the range from which you can ambush enemies from a hiding spot is greatly reduced from what it is in Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\nThen you have the boss fights, in which all sense of balance goes out the window. Most bosses can and will kill your party in one or two hits even if you're the appropriate level to be fighting them, and the party member AI is simply not equipped to deal with them. For me, most of the boss fights consisted of having my entire party die immediately followed by me taking control of whoever was left and alternating between mashing the dodge button and getting in one or two physical attacks before repeating the process.\n\nGone is the ability to creatively use spells or Persona fusion to address the difficulty: spells cost several times what they do in Persona 5 and your party members have less than a quarter of the SP they normally would have. The idea is that you're supposed to do attack chains that end in your Persona casting a weaker version of a spell for free.. except there's no easy way to control which spell it casts if it has more than one. I believe it's based on the number of times you hit the light attack button before hitting special attack, but it seems random to me.\n\nFusion is also significantly nerfed - there are fewer Personas in the game and a lot of them have been nerfed to the ground from P5 or Royal. There's no opportunity to get creative with fusion the way there is in the real game, where you can make a Persona specifically to address certain situations.. meaning that there will be situations where you simply do not have an answer to what the game is presenting you with. \n\nThe game tries to address this by giving you frequent save points, from which you can go through multiple loading screens to recover your HP and SP by leaving for the real world from the dungeon and then coming back.. instead of having, I dunno, a button that you can just press at the save point. Considering that you can use maybe three heals on a full SP bar (and each one heals maybe a third of your HP) this means you'll be seeing load screens a lot.\n\nThen there's the frequent issues linked to this game's poor implementation of Denuvo: random crashes, hanging on loading screens, slowdowns and frame lag. \n\nGive this one a pass until it's on deep discount.",

        "content": "Strikers is a very welcome surprise. While it may look like a simple Dynasty Warriors clone with a Persona skin, the reality is that this game has a LOT of depth behind it.\n\nThe action-based combat retains a lot of the systems at play in P5 and P5R - elemental weaknesses, technical attacks, status moves, buffing and debuffing, 1-More attacks, All Out Attacks, Baton Passes - you name it and Strikers has most likely implemented it in some fashion. In addition to the core systems, each character feels fantastic to play - each boasting unique movesets, abilities and progression paths, as well as displaying a lot of their personality in their fighting style. To put it simply, there's a lot more to the combat than meets the eye, and those who have previously played the original Persona 5 or Royal will appreciate the small details here.\n\nThe story so far (around 16 hours in) feels very lively thanks to the strong returning cast of characters as well as the two great new additions, Sophia and Zenkichi. The English version brings more fantastic performances which give the game a unique charm, and while the stakes don't feel too high at the moment, the relationships these characters have with each other make each moment feel endearing.\n\nThe music, my god the music. Straight up bangers everywhere. Do yourself a favour and listen to one of the new battle themes, Daredevil. If that doesn't get you excited to beat up some demons, I don't know what will.\n\nA caveat I will mention and the one gripe I have with the game do far is that ultimately it is a sequel, meaning it's difficult to recommend to new players who didn't experience the original game. You could probably enjoy Strikers by reading a synopsis of P5's plot and characters, but really you would just be doing yourself a disservice. As great as I've found Strikers as a massive fan of its predecessor, the lack of a PC port of the original makes it a very hard sell.\n\nIf you're willing to look past that, or you've already a fan who has played P5 / P5R, you will most likely fall in love with the Phantom Thieves all over again in Strikers.",

The real time combat in Persona Strikers is smooth, takes a lot of combat aspects from Persona 5, and is a ton of fun. Definitely pick this up if you're a Personal 5 fan and like the idea of real time combat that's great fun!",

For any fans of Persona, ESPECIALLY PERSONA 5, I highly recommend this, even though I'm not that far.",

        "content": "Ever since I played vanilla persona 5 about 2 years ago, I've been sucked into this series and have loved every second of it. As a big fan, seeing strikers get a PC port meant more persona on PC and an instant buy from me. As expected, I am not disappointed. This combat, while it does take a while to master, is extremely addicting and is the highlight of the game so far for me. The story is entertaining as well, and travelling across a bunch of cities with the gang is a vibe. As this is the first game in the P5 universe on steam, playing it just really makes me want Persona 5 Royal on steam that much more. Seeing my favorite game get the port that everyone has been begging for would really be like a dream.  As for this game, if you're a fan its a must buy, but for others you do need to play vanilla persona 5 to understand anything in this game.",

        "content": "Wait a minute. Atlus released a new Persona game on PC? And it's day in date with PS4?! What is this madness?!\n\nBut it's true. If the message to Playstation fanboys didn't come through that Atlus PC ports are here to stay, this does now. This is now Atlus' second PC port they've done themselves fresh off of Persona 4 Golden (which they did a fantastic job on and you should go buy and play that game now. Do it.) Now Koei Tecmo did codevelop the game, but the good news is they had no part in the port at all. It was all Atlus. KT only made the combat mechanics, while Atlus made the rest of the game.\n\nSo how does the port fair? THEY MANAGED TO MAKE A PC PORT BETTER THAN P4G, in such a short amount of time too! Atlus is a newcomer to the modern world of PC gaming, and they're already making ports like seasoned vets. Everything is fast, smooth, and fluid, and runs amazingly. If the port for Strikers is this good, then the eventual port of Persona 5 Royal will be even better. (Seriously Atlus, get on that.)\n\nSo, what is Persona 5 Strikers? Well, it is the sequel to Persona 5, only instead of a lifesim turn based JRPG, it's a musou, but don't let that discourage you. It's a musou designed for people who don't like musous, like me. It plays less like the traditional Warriors games and plays more like a Persona game that's real time action instead. And man they nail the power fantasy. You feel like a slick badass as you slice and dice through massive hordes as your favorite Phantom Thieves. One thing to note: If you're expecting the social life and RPG mechanics the Persona series is known for, you're gonna be sorely disappointed. Strikers is action and action only. Don't let that discourage you from buying it, because when going through the massive levels it plays like a big action oriented Persona game. That's not a complaint, it's a warning.\n\nStorywise, it's really big for what is on paper just a musou spinoff of Persona. The game is a sequel taking place six months after the events of vanilla Persona 5 (so storybeats from Royal will not be present. However the playable Phantom Thieves from Royal will be making an appearance as DLC later in the year.) It is summer vacation and a new threat emerges as wicked evil people are mind controlling people by stealing their desires, and it's up to you to beat them up and all their endless hordes. If you haven't played Persona 5 yet, do so before playing, otherwise you're gonna get spoiled hard, as well as lost on what is happening.\n\nBut that brings me to my biggest complaint of the game, and it's not the game itself, but the release. The Persona series finally broke free from Playstation exclusivity, and everyone is hype off the heels of Persona 4 Golden wondering what's next? Would Persona 5 come next? That's a logical move since Persona 5 is the hot new game everyone's raving about. Well instead, the game we got was the sequel to Persona 5. People really want Persona 5 Royal and have been begging for years to come to other platforms especially PC so we don't have to emulate vanilla P5 through RPCS3 anymore and could support the devs. But instead we got this game, a game that probably won't sell well on PC since we don't have the first game to go off of. My only guess to this is SEGA wanted Strikers to get a PC release first since it was coming out next, and they're basically playing catchup. But man, does it sting STILL not having Persona 5 especially since they know we want it after they made that press release about the emulator C&D. All I can hope is that Royal gets a PC port announced soon, similar to the missing Yakuza games getting announced for PC a month after Like a Dragon released. We need Royal on PC ASAP, especially for this game.",

The only complaint, if any is that the camera could've used a little more work but the counter to that is a lovable/colorful cast, fun battle system, and fun side indulgences like cooking (I do love my cooking mechanics). Honestly, not the most in-depth review but for someone who has entered the P5 universe with this game, I am having a lot of fun; definitely recommended!",

Every loading screen you're rolling the dice as to whether or not you're going to crash, and the fact that you can only save at specific spots means you may not be able to recover your progress if it crashes before you can save.",

Other than that if you like those musou games then you will enjoy this game but the adds actually can hit hard if you ignore them lol. My only complaint of the game is that it can easily just deteriorate to mashing the attack button and I don't know what i'm doing half the time. Maybe that will change after the third dungeon. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5/royal and wants more persona content and happens to like action rpg or musou elements. \n\nGameplay 8/10 \nMusic 10/10\nVisuals 9/10",

Do not play this unless you have played Persona 5.\nIf you have played Persona 5, I don't think you need me to tell you why I'm recommending a direct story sequel to it.\n\nSlight performance issues with the PC port. The framerate is capped at 60, and game logic is tied to the framerate. There's two modes: 30fps mode and 60fps mode. On 60fps mode with my GTX1060, I can't even maintain 10fps on medium at times, whereas on 30fps mode, I'm comfortably locked at 30fps even on high graphics. It's very bizzare. The default keybinds are not super logical but the kb+m controls are otherwise fine. Generally an okay port overall; definitely playable, if not entirely ideal.",

Seeing these characters I love moving around in 4k at a silky smooth 60fps is a dream. \n\nThe biggest problem with this game is the story pacing and the battles. Honestly I wish they would have just made this with the regular battle system. It is so much better than this musou stuff. So far the battles have been kind of a joke. I was over two hours in before I had even taken any damage. There are also some REALLY long cutscenes. Much longer than the original game(s).\n\nIf you aren't a fan of the previous P5 games I don't think there is much for you here. \n\nDEAR ATLUS PLEASE PORT PERSONAL 5 ROYAL TO PC!!!!",

Being a hack n' slash veteran, I can judge for myself and say that it's easy to spot a difference. It was quite hard for me to get introduced to the new mechanics such as abilities, fast forward, ect.\n\nIt's worth mentioning how Atlus actually made a follow up to the P5 story and brings an amazing comeback to the Phantom thieves.

Playing Persona 5 beforehand is not required in order to enjoy and understand the story, but it is clear that you are expected to have played Persona 5 beforehand due to this game taking place after the events of Persona 5 and main cast being the same.\n\nAs someone who has NOT played Persona 5 (I've always wanted to... on PC/Steam), I hope ATLUS release Persona 5 on Steam so I can return to this game for a second playthrough to enjoy it to its fullest.",

It will come to the Epic Games Store in March.* The game takes almost no time to explain who the characters are and what the story is from the first game, so you'd need that knowledge before stepping into this game. And don't just watch a video online explaining it, I don't think the characters are as likeable as they are without the proper context.\n\nI had already finished this game on my Switch, but it was the Japanese version (since that was already released a year ago). And let me tell you, the ability to play this in 60 fps just makes it so much better. That and I can actually understand what I'm reading. I already enjoyed my time on the Switch, ignoring the 30 and under fps and long loading times, I'm still glad I bought the Japanese version. But I know for sure I won't be coming back to it for a long time.\n\n*The article lied to me.",

        "content": "TLDR: you'll probably like this game if you're a Persona fan. \n\nUpdate #2 (20 hours in): The 2nd \"dungeon\" wasn't all that interesting, but the combat continues to be fun. The story is definitely getting more interesting at this point.\n\nUpdate (13 hours in): The story is picking up now and the enemies are getting tougher. It's ramping up like a typical Persona game.\n\nReview in progress: \n\nAs a Persona fan, I can tell you this truly FEELS like a Persona game. \n\nThat means you get the best and worst of Persona in every form. I'm about 7 hours into Strikers, and the pacing is incredibly slow, just like Persona 5. This game mirrors Persona in the sense that it really doesn't respect your time, but it also mirrors it in having an interesting story, fun new characters that expand the Persona lore, and all of the usual hijinks you expect from the series. \n\nThe gameplay here is very novel and repetitive. They've adapted pretty much all Persona mechanics to a third person action game format, and that's rad. You get to play with the whole cast and level up their abilities. If you find the style of game fun, you'll have a great time. If you get easily bored of beating up large groups of mostly weak enemies, you'll probably get bored of Strikers. \n\nSo far, I feel like I can recommend this to Persona fans. There are some crashing and black screen issues, but you can work around them. \n\nP.S. it's still really cringy how sexualized some of the characters are, just like in every Persona game. If that cringe is enough for you to not like a game, Strikers won't be for you.",

It recaptures the same charm of the original while changing the genre entirely. If I had to pick out a flaw, it's that the dungeons, or \"jails\" feel very repetitive. They all have the same structure, unlike Persona 5's structure which usually included gimmicks.\n\nTL;DR:\nPlay the game, make sure you've played vanilla Persona 5 first.\n(Not saying you *should* emulate PS3 games, but persona 5 is technically a ps3 game and there are ps3 emulators online...)",

        "content": "I honestly was a little worried for this game. I enjoyed P5R, but I felt it leaned a little too heavily into fan service, and as a result wasn't as good as just regular Persona 5 (that and I'm still mad about how broken Okumura was in that game, but that's a different story.) This game though - I might actually like it more than Persona 5. The combat is fast paced and intense, where you're swapping between characters rapidly for follow up attacks, hitting weaknesses, and using environmental objects to beat down shadows. I never thought I'd get to play as a cat wearing a bandit mask on a skateboard running over Jack Frost, but here we are.\n\nThe social aspect of this game is definitely [i]different[/i] than in Persona 5, though I wouldn't say it's worse. It's a lot more based on exploring cities for cool moments with your team and building the team skills you want out of the social points you earn for spending time with them. The time system is also very different than in P5. Though the calendar still progresses, it moves with set story points rather than each time you leave a palace or spend time with a friend. Again, this isn't [i]worse[/i] than P5, it's just different. Strikers is trying to put a pretty decently sized game into one summer vacation, so they only have what, six weeks to tell their story? I think it took me more than six weeks to get my first confidants to max rank in P5, so I have to admit that this system works a lot better for this setup.\n\nThe real highlight for me so far though is honestly the characters. Persona 5 had some great villains, but most of them were irredeemably awful people, end of story. This game though is willing to tread into grey area a lot more willingly. You're going to face off against objectively bad people - but you'll also see why they became this way, how they're real people tumbling down slippery slopes of mistakes and bad decisions.  Without getting too much into spoiler territory, the two bosses I've gone against so far have had a lot more dimension than the earlier bosses of P5. This entire tangent is also ignoring the new NPCs who are on your side. I've found these characters to be quirky, interesting, and willing to add some life and spirit to an already vibrant group. Even the Phantom Thieves' dynamic feels a little more polished than in P5; The team, while still up to their usual antics, are calling out great kills by specific members, appreciating even Ryuii's accomplishments. I know, people not making fun of Ryujii. Who'd have thought we'd see the day?\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is a mix of funky new jams and the original P5 soundtrack on steroids. What's not to love?\n\nTL;DR: A sequel has a lot to live up to, especially if it's changing genres, and this absolutely exceeded my expectations.  I paid 10 extra dollars to play this game four days early and absolutely regret nothing.",

        "content": "Wow, So, you get THE TEAM. You know? THE TEAM! Joker, Panther, Haru, Morgana, Fox, Queen, Jail Bait who is still unplayable, and the newly added Jail Bait v.2 The game is flashy and STYLISH in the typical persona fasion except brought to us in the form of a musou game. So you can hack slash bomb and punch your way to the new world without having to press X to guard the next attack. It mixes up the typical musou formula by adding elements that were present in p5 and takes on a truly unique spin to what a musou fan would be used to. What more could a fan want? This is the team we know, This is the team we love.\n\nWell...\n\nI cannot recommend this game to either a persona fan or a musou fan, If you are coming from a game like DW or WO where you get 50+ unique characters with different personalities, unique skills, unique weapons, and unique abilities to attach to those weapons you are going to be left wanting because here all you get is about 6 characters with unique personalities, Personas (skills) and Weapons. They have shrunk the formula here and made things much simpler in order to appease the original fan base (presumably, there is no document stating that) which failed in my opinion. Reason it failed is because the original fan base is still left wanting as well. There was so much potential to introduce new phantom thieves with this \"sequel\" The Doctor, The GunShop owner, The Teacher, Lavenza (who is actually 2 people)  all of them could have been included or added later and present a unique set of weapons and game play elements. The game is EXTREMELY repetitive which is typical for a musou, HOWEVER, usually you get bored try a new character from a roster of 50+ people and here you get to get bored and try a new character about 6 times, if you get bored beyond that you are SOL so you better REALLY enjoy a particular move set. \n\nHonestly...\n\nI could go on but that's about the gist of it. They tried to merge two different worlds and ending failing both of them. Which is sad cause i really do love these phantom thieves.\n\nThanks & Good Luck\n\n",

        "content": "Only like 6 hours in the game and can tell you that this game is truly a work of art. The gameplay is very fun and what makes it even better is the fact that they made each and every character's kit and moveset completely unique on top of the mindblowing soundtrack (which is basically a given in any game in the franchise) and design. I am playing on hard difficulty just because I didn't want to blow through the game in a day and it pretty tough for me, as someone who hasn't really played this genre of game at all. But despite that, I've never once gotten irritated at failing multiple times in a fight, rather I think about what I could do differently until I figure out what works and what doesn't and amidst that, memorizing the movesets of the enemies until I eventually complete the encounter, feeling a sense of accomplishment after several failed attempts. That however is only the tip of the iceberg, it takes some of the core things from vanilla P5 and incorporates it quite smoothly into itself, which in turn makes it feel like a true successor to vanilla. For 60$, I honestly believe that this game is worth every cent. 10/10 would cat van again.",

It never quite reaches the levels of P5/P5R but it's more persona and more of the characters you love however, at this very moment in time I would not recommend it due to constant crashes during cut scenes. So far I've encountered about 10 crashes of the game sometimes taking hours me back multiple hours of progress because of long sections of the game not allowing you to save and or me forgetting. If this is fixed then I'll change this review but until then the crashes are so frustrating at this moment in time it's simply not worth it.",

If you did not play the original game, then you will have absolutely no clue what's going on, and I appreciate that. They don't spend any time going over past events and treat the player with respect that this is a sequel and prior knowledge is necessary. \n\nThe gang is back together and they are just as charming as they ever were - arguably more so because no time needs to be spent on introductions, so they can just leap straight into playing off eachother as close friends. Just seeing these characters reunite brought a lump to my throat. So far, the writing has made each character actually feel slightly more impactful than in P5 as they seem to be all pulling their own weight in conversation and nobody is getting left behind *cough Yusuke/Haru*\n\nThe style is BACK, BABY! The menus are still incredibly satisfying to flit through, the all-out attacks feel better to enact than ever, and the new additions are all extremely welcome. The combat feels absolutely joyous and I have zero complaints about the change from turn-based to frantic hack and slash. \n\nMy only recommendations to the devs would be A: add widescreen support and B: give me better sound mixing as the effects seem a little too loud and drown out the music and VA which are both exceptional.\n\nThank you Atlus for bringing this game to the rest of the world and to PC!!!! Keep this up!",

        "content": "im mainly writing this for myself as a way for me to write how i feel about the game so far so i can come back to this after i finish the game to see if my mind changes. so basically ive played both base persona 5 and royal within the span of a year and really enjoyed the games due to the confidants, overall style of the game, ost, story, freedom to do whatever i want when i want up to a time limit, etc etc it was a really solid game. i also really enjoy jrgs so that also improved the experience for me. so when i heard that the spin off/ sequel of p5 would be a hack and slash rpg game instead i was a little offput by it but overtime as i heard and seen more about the game i decided to give it a shot even going as far as pre ordering it. about a week before the game drops early for before he spent 10 extra dollars (me) i get spoiled that they are no confidants in the game by an invasive ass article google shoved in my face so at that point im not feeling too good but nonetheless i was still hopeful for the game and waited. fast forward to when i install and launch the game and... bruh. while i was playing the whole time it felt like something was off and then i realized that they replaced all of the cool style font that would be at the top right and is used on the characters name with some generic ms word font. that alone is a major turn off for me. but like 5 more mins in when the squad needs to go buy supplies and shit its dropped that both the doctor and airsoft owners are both not in the game for some bullshit \"summer closing' reason. this made me wanna turn off the game tbh. they also made it to where you cant enter stores like you use to be able and its just a stock menu when you go to enter. instead in persona 5 where you can get supplies from a bunch of places theres now only one bitch boy store page to get weapons, armor, items, etc from and it feels like such a downgrade. overall so far this entire game feels like downgrade and im hoping im only being a giga bitch rn and the game gets better. oh and the combat is cool or whatever",

One of the best soundtracks I've heard.. feeling H Y P E D all the time fighting Shadows \\m/ All of their SHOWTIME is LIT. For people who played Persona 5 you will really feel nostalgic.. and you will just long for a new Persona game. \n\nI've come to appreciate other characters even more because you get to see a different side of them. (don't want to spoil anything)  Their fighting styles are unique (DUH) so you never get bored of the game (especially with the Last surprise song lmao)\n\nI really recommend this to people who played Persona. and for people who are curious and never played Persona 5 or any persona game **COUGH** There's persona 4 Golden in steam **COUGH**  but just wants to kick ass, steal hearts and want to taste a bit how a persona game works.. then this game can be added to your Library! You'll eventually like the characters though if you really wanna know them more then play Persona 5! (or maybe watch the Anime? lol)  \n\nbut yeah overall i love this game <3 and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

The music rocks, the gameplay is surprisingly engaging and somewhat difficult. The style helps encapsulate a feeling of badass combat. And the story is fun, nothing mind blowing from what I've played, but it doesn't have to be, it knows what it wants to be, and I think it achieves what it sets out to do very well. If you like P5 and fast based combat and exploration, get this game, it's just more time with your favorite characters with a new gameplay style that kicks ass!\n\n*Update* I think most of what I said before stays true after finishing the game, my only new statement is that I think the game lasts a bit too long for a sequel spin off, and that the new characters sell the story the most out of everyone in the cast. I still recommend this game",

        "content": "Cleared the game (as of 03.25.2021) but will keep the review spoiler free.\n\nPros\n- A legit continuation of P5 (not P5R). The story illustrates the growth of the Phantom Thieves and is fantastic. \n- Killer soundtrack. My favorite is Blooming Villan, River in the Desert, and Counterstrike. \n- Doesn't chug on 60 FPS. \n- The new characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, are a fantastic addition to the cast. Usually the new characters tend to hog the spotlight or something but not too much with these two. \n- A Musou game that blends P5's style and system very well. \n- The right amount of difficulty. Once you cleared some hurdles, the game offers you the Merciless option (Risky in JP) and that'll definitely challenge the player's skill (to illustrate how hard Merciless is, you might die in the tutorial if you think you can just waltz in and tank everything). \n- New game plus option.\n\nCons\n- Map navigation might be a bit disorientating at first since you'll be going up and down and all over. I definitely got disorientated at the Shibuya Jail.\n- Inventory management could use some work. You'll be spending a good minute looking for the right recovery mid-fight. \n- You can't jump between Jail to Jail. This might be a bit tedious when you're trying to clear some requests. \n- The chaotic nature of a Musou game might catch some people off guard if they never played one. \n- You won't be able to swap out members mid battle like you did in P5 so if you run into a mid-boss that your not prepared for, you'll have a hard time. \n- A lot of Persona's were cut. This includes the awakened forms of your teammates. \n- Though your main attack is physical, physical Persona moves were nerfed. In P5S, the cost to use the physical Persona moves are based off your total HP and the skill that mitigates the cost of physical Persona moves isn't available. So yeah you can't go mindless and spam Yoshitsune's Hassotobi to decimate your foes. \n\nMix\n- A lot of the P5 casts won't be returning here.\n- Morally gray bosses.\n- The game doesn't really teach you some crucial tips. For example, you can use your items to recover during combat. I did not realize that after a couple of game overs. \n- The bosses are paired with one of your party members for story (for example, Alice and Ann). However, there are two characters that don't have that kind of scenario which is a bummer. However, those two shine throughout the story in general so it's not a total loss.\n- Though it said you'll be going all over Japan, it's more of a slice. I did wish we could explore real-world Kyoto.\n- No DLCs. This isn't a deal breaker (and it's not like DLC = win button) but I did wish we could use P4's Izanagi or P3's Thanatos and jam to Raidou's battle theme. \n- You won't be able to fight against attendants like you did in past Persona games unfortunately (usually they're set up as a hidden boss). However P5S still does it right and prepared a fan favorite of the Persona series as the hidden boss. \n\nConclusion\n- This is a game that I definitely would recommend to anyone who loves P5 or P5R and who's into Musou games. \n- Unlike a generic Musou games, it's very story heavy and won't get as repetitive (definitely a fresh take for me at least). \n- You will definitely tumble in the beginning as you get used to the battle system, but once you understand and master it, it's very fun. \n\nPS\nThe game definitely suffered a messaging issue upon it's first announcement (a lot of people thought it was going to be a generic Musou game with Persona characters thrown in it). After the first and second PV though, I think Atlus got the messaging issue fixed and assured the audience that this was a legit Persona game.",

        "content": "*I ordered the digital deluxe edition so I was able to play early*\n\nThis game has a problem for me on fullscreen mode as the game will not load after launching my save file. So I resorted to using borderless windowed mode instead and it worked. \n\nSo far however, the game has been really fun, sometimes even challenging even on normal mode, and we get to experience a brand new story with our beloved cast of characters.\n\nMy biggest gripe probably has to be the dungeon crawling. The dungeon crawling feels a lot \"stiff\" compared to its JRPG counter part. The camera is very very hard to deal with in tight spaces as well. \n\nPeople might be turned off by the fact that this IS a musou game, but the mix with Persona 5's JRPG elements make it so that enemies are not free roaming for you to bash mindlessly, and that enemies are actually more so just encounters you stumble upon. The Persona summons are definitely fun to use, however (and this is just a minor gripe on my half) SP in the beginning of the game is so scarce and that most of the time I am actually fighting SP-less. \n\nOverall, I am happy that this game is able to differentiate itself from other musou-type games, and it is definitely unique on its own. \n\nTo end off, Sophia is very adorable, and I think she's a great inclusion to the cast so far. I am definitely looking forward to playing more.",

        "content": "I came in to persona 5 strikers having played persona 5 (the original, not royal) and beaten it on a PS4. While I'm very excited to see more persona titles on steam, such as 4 golden, and 5 strikers, I really hope we see more of the main games ported. Persona 3, Persona 5, ect. If you've played and enjoyed persona 5, you'll probably like strikers. The same characters are back for a \"Vacation\" story focused around old friends getting back together.  The gameplay is solid, the anime cutscenes are high quality, and the graphics are very pretty! This game is great on the couch with a controller, or with a keyboard and mouse, although I prefer this as a couch title personally. If you haven't played persona 5 yet, you might not enjoy this game as much. I'm sure it would feel similar to joining a well established friend group, and realizing you kinda get most of the insight jokes, but that you also have a sense of loss that you weren't there when they were created. Regardless, story isn't the only attraction here, and the gameplay is solid enough that I can still recommend strikers to someone who hasn't played persona 5. That being said, Atlus, please give us persona 3 and persona 5 on steam. The whole \"Steam vs other platforms such as epic\" argument might sound shallow on paper, but steam is offering so many wonderful features that no other storefront can. A big example of this is Proton support, which allows windows games to run on linux. Valve is hardware and software agnostic, allowing many gamers to come together and enjoy their favorite titles in the way they'd like. I'm happy to support Atlus on my platform of choice, as it is a platform that supports my freedom of choice. Here's to more wonderful persona games coming to steam in the future. We're glad to have you here! \n\nBest Regards, -PR0XIDIAN",

        "content": "You can play as your waifu, turn into vehicles to mow down hordes of cute persona designs, and bop to some solid music tracks from all persona games. I couldn't ask for anything more.\n\n\nOn a serious note, this game brings a trimmed down, but still immensely enjoyable version of Persona 5's overworld, with a twist for the combat. It translates surprising well to an action based hack and slash. There will be an adjustment period for anyone who's previously played a persona game because several of the button assignments are different to compensate for the new combat (like the persona summoning menu is now a special attack button).  The platforming is also no longer on rails for the most part, so movement is a bit more choppy than it was in persona 5.\n\nHowever, after an hour or two of getting used to fighting, its a surprisingly rewarding experience. It emphasizes reflexes and situational awareness to dodge attacks and use combos to fire off skills seamlessly. As well as rewarding persona building, because having the right set of skills to hit weaknesses or apply crowd control can be the a major factor in how smoothly a fight will go.\n\nHard mode even provides a pleasant challenge, forcing you to pay attention in most encounters, or else you most likely be overwhelmed by enemy abilities and attacks. Forcing you to really dive into the combat system, and learn to string together combos and dodging efficiently.\n\nI was expecting something good as a spin off, but it went beyond my expectations into a great game to play on its own. A legitimate 9/10 from my time with it so far.",

        "content": "This is what we want Sega/Atlus, more Persona and other games ports on PC please.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent and at the start I thought it was just a total cash grab due to the price but this is a genuine Persona game even with the involment of Koei Tecmo in this game. This is actually what a non Turn-role Persona game would be like. It is more of a Persona game than a Dynasty Warrior clone.\n\nThe game takes place after the event of Persona 5 during the summer vacation as the Phantom Thieves yet again find theirselves in another quest to change hearts.\n\nGameplay; Smooth 60fps locked. No drops. it is to be noted that some cutscenes are running at 30fps but there isnt many of them. The key bindings isn't that bad and it is easy to learn them and can be changed if you need to. The combat is very fast paced and the mechanics are well implemented. I'd give it a 9/10.\n\nGraphics: They are not bad but also not superb due to something that looks like a lack of strong AA but overall they are fine. 7.5/10\n\nSpecs needed: This game is not very demanding and even 700 series GTX cards can handle it fine as long as you tune the settings a bit. 8/10.\n\nMusic: Now this is the part that is actually an absolute hit. If you do buy the digital deluxe edition you have access to battle ost from previous persona games ranging from Persona revelation up to Persona 5 Strikers. The sound quality in Persona games is alway top notch and this one delivers as well. 9.5/10.\n\nFinal thoughts: Should you buy it? I would say wait for sales because, the standard version really doesn't shine like the digital deluxe edition with all its bonuses. However, for long time persona fans, I doubt this will be too much of a concern to them. I should also mention that , even if you did not play Persona 5 this is not an issue as this game seems to be a total different setting. Also thanks to Koei Tecmo for making this game with Atlus.\n\nMy overall score: 8.5/10.",

        "content": "With this game being in a somewhat unique situation, there's three main areas I want to address in this review: playing this game without playing Persona 5, the state of the PC port, and the game itself. \n\nPC Port up first! The port is very simplistic unfortunately. No ultrawide support, capped at 60fps, and limited settings to adjust (there is an internal resolution scaler though, which can go up to 2.0). The port runs well though - I have an 8700k and a 3080, and I've had basically a locked 60fps at 1440p with all settings maxed and the scaler set to 2.0 (and I haven't hit any bugs yet, but I've only played for a few hours). I imagine that this game will be able to run on a very wide variety of PCs, which is good. One minor complaint I do have however is that the UI is pretty big, and there's no option to re-size it. It's not too much of an issue when running around the world, but during battle it very much gets in the way. \n\nWhat's not good is that you really shouldn't play this game if you haven't played Persona 5 (And like many, I am absolutely baffled that they haven't brought P5 to PC yet. Especially with this game being a direct sequel). Not only will you spoil some great P5 moments for yourself, but this game doesn't really do anything to hold your hand story-wise. It does some very baseline \"story setup\" in regards to the overall world and lore, but it very much assumes that you've played Persona 5 (or are at least very familiar with it and the characters). So if you haven't played, chances are that you'll have no idea what on earth is happening or who any of these characters are. \n\nAs for the game itself, so far I'm enjoying it! I'm not completely sold on the combat yet (which I'll get to a bit later), but the game feels like a legitimate Persona 5 sequel. I don't know how much of a hand that Atlus had in development and how much was Omega Force, but this game feels right at home with Persona 5 in terms of the writing and character interactions. As always, the voice actors have brought their A-game (I'm playing with English VO) and they do just as great of a job as in P5. Omega Force has introduced a few new characters as well, and they all feel like they just fit right in. I'm sure you'll have heard about Sophia by the time you play, and yes - she is as precious as everyone says she is. \n\nHowever, don't go in expecting a full-blooded Persona game. As far as I'm aware, there are no confidant levels, no school, no social stats to level up, etc. While this absolutely feels like a proper sequel in terms of tone and design, just remember that it's a Persona-themed hack and slash game, and not an actual Persona game proper. And with that, we come to the combat! Which is hard to give a full opinion on because I've only played the game for a few hours but I'm going to do my best to give my thoughts as I have them. \n\nConceptually, I love combat (also as a note, I'm playing with a PS4 controller so I'll be referring to it for the button layout). Each character has standard attacks that you'll button mash with the Square button, a special attack (that can be weaved into combos) that's mapped to Triangle, and their persona which is summoned by holding down R1. Hitting Triangle will do different things depending on when it's used in a combo. Using Triangle does something different than if hitting it after hitting Square 2 times, or 3, or 4 (each one presents a different ability). While each character performs combos in the same way (each character has a Square + Triangle combo, a Square + Square + Triangle combo, etc) they do different things for each character, and it can be a bit overwhelming to keep it all straight. However, I imagine that this will naturally dissipate as the game is played for longer. \n\nWhen holding down R1 to summon your persona, battle freezes - this lets you choose your persona/ability and choose the area to deploy it at your leisure. You can switch between any party member at any time if they're in your current party (you're still limited to 4 party members, but these party members can be switched when not in combat), and you can even run around as your chosen party member while in the Metaverse, which I really like. When a typical battle starts, you'll run into one of 3 enemy types: general blade fodder, personas, and \"boss\" personas. The blade fodder are just faceless enemies that you can hack and slack your way through, and don't present any challenge at all. Personas are the personas that we know and love from P5, and this is where you'll want to use the correct party member/persona ability to target their affinities. \"Boss\" personas (I put boss in quotes because it's not an actual boss, they're just tougher versions of the normal personas) can take multiple affinity hits before getting knocked down, and are generally tougher to kill/do more damage. \n\nThere's a lot more to combat, but that's the elevator pitch. Why am I hesitant on it? Because honestly, at times it feels very frantic and unfocused. As mentioned at the beginning, the battle UI takes up way too much of your screen. It's at least 1/4, if not 1/3 of your screen real estate. Add to that all of your party members mashing their standard attack and sending off persona abilities, plus the enemies are doing the same, it results in so much visual overload that I can barely keep track of what's going on. The game recommends trying to use different party members to chain together combos and such, but I can barely keep track of what's going on - there's no way I'll be able to chain things together efficiently. It's also difficult to keep track of your own health - the in-game characters will sound off voice dialogue to let you know that your health is getting low, but sometimes you miss it with the amount of stuff happening on screen and it all just feels a little hectic. \n\nAll that being said, I'm still enjoying the game thoroughly. This is about as close to a \"Persona 5 2\" as we'll ever get, and it's a damn fine follow up. When you're only facing a few enemies and can actually pull off the combos that the game wants you to, it's very satisfying. I'm hoping that my problems with the combat will go away as I get more used to it, but only time will tell there (I'll most likely update this review after finishing the game). If you love this world and these characters, I highly recommend playing this game.",

        "content": "Updated April 29th\n\nI haven't touched the game much ever since I platinum the game, so I just realized that the game had a new patch. I hope that this patch had fixed some of the problems, so I would revise my review to recommend until I try the game myself again and figure out how they really do.\n\nUpdated March 8th\n[h1]WAIT FOR A PATCH[/h1]\nFinished the main plot. The game and the plot is top notch but wait for a patch. I will definitely recommend this game if atlus at least spent time trying to fix these problems.\nMy loading time got fixed after updating the driver. However, I start to run into random crashes in my after-run. Most frustratingly, usually after boss fights.\n________________________________________________\nUpdated March 5th\nAfter keep searching on the forum and elsewhere, I finally solve the problem by updating my graphic driver. Although the fix on the forum says that to roll back the driver to 460.79, I was on that version of the driver, so I tried my luck updating the driver and it surprisingly fixed the problem. It was hell of a journey, and I don't think this game is worth recommending to others unless there is a patch coming out addressing all the crashes and porting problems.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdated March 3rd\nI cannot proceed to play the game. I got stuck after the boss fight in 5th jail. Infinite loading black screen. Funny thing is every time I close the game I can here a bit audio as if the game has not crashed. This is a problem faced by many other players and I have tried all kinds of fixed but none really worked.\n[spoiler]I have fight my copy for more than 10 times now and I am literally speed running the boss fight. I am tired.[/spoiler]\n\nI have point out many other bugs brought by the port but none really affected my experience this much. This one literally caused me not able to play the game anymore.\n\nI love the game and the series. But seriously, fix the port Atlus.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAs many reviewers said, it is very hard to get onto the game if you are a new comer to the series or, to be more specific, you haven't played the previous game Persona 5. If you want to fully enjoy this game and cannot get your hands on P5/P5R, a good place to start is to watch the Animated series [url=https://p5ausa.com/]Persona 5 The Animation[/url]. Although the quality of the animation isn't the highest, it covers all the important stories and can get enough background information to not get lost playing this game.\n\nAs for the game itself, so far so good. Need to play more to see if this game can match or even beat P5.\n\n\u81ea\u5e26\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4f4e\u4ef7\u533a\u6bd4\u6e2f\u670d\u6253\u6298\u8fd8\u8981\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u597d\u8bc4\uff01\n\n[Updated after 10 hrs playtime]\nAfter finishing the first part of the story, I have a general grasp on how the game is played and can say more on the performance and gameplay itself.\nThere are some flaws to the game, including relatively longer load time comparing to other games and to playing it on PS5 (I am running this game also on a high-performance SSD). Especially when I load up the game, it usually takes me 10 to 15 seconds to actually be able to play the game. I am not sure the problem can be fixed, and it is rather minor problem, but this will be frustrating after more hours of playtime, which I know I will be having. Another thing that stands out to me is that although I am playing this game on a controller, the character can only move along the 8 axis using the left stick. This is definitely bad porting, and I haven't experienced anything like this on other ported games like Yakuza series or Atlus' own Persona 4 Golden.\n\nGameplay is solid so far, but also missing out on a lot of thing that really made persona series stands out from other JRPG games - daily interactions. While the game still using the calendar system like its predecessors, there are less layer to that because you are free to spend however long time you want in one day and do whatever you want. Being able to go and return palace (jails) freely without worrying about time passing is more player-friendly, but it feels like cheating to just freely go in and out to recover your hp and sp.\nUp till this point of the game, I haven't had any side stories and bonding time with other characters. The city has much less things to explore and places to go. Although it seems like we got to visit more cities, so that might still be fun.\nI guess I just miss the time to spend with all my [spoiler]waifus[/spoiler]friends and school life.\nThe fighting is fun, and the way the incorporate the old persona system to this musou type game is very interesting.\n\nA solid 8/10 so far. Definitely recommend if you have played Persona 5 before, and worth to play if you haven't and don't mind missing out on some stories or spend time watching the anime series",

        "content": "ive had a lot of fun so far!! the persona battle elements keep it from being like other hack and slash type games, so if you're not a fan of those this might still be worth a try. the story is a direct sequel to persona 5 and it doesn't offer much explanation so definitely play that before picking this up! ive had minor issues with crashing and a few animations are a little wonky, but otherwise its a very good game - just be sure to save often :) here's a few fyis for people playing:\n\nthe preset keyboard controls are a nightmare. i highly recommend using a controller, but if you really don't want to then be sure to go into config and reset them to whatever works for you. once you get past the main menu you have to play through the entire prologue before getting the chance to do it again so this is super important if you dont want to be reaching over to press H and N constantly! \n\nyou can leave the metaverse at any checkpoint, with no time penalty. if you're low on sp just leave and immediately come back, there's no reason not to. you should also be using healing skills more often than items, because there's essentially an infinite supply of sp. save your healing items for battles.\n\nsimilar to the last game, its best that everyone stays alive, even if they're at 1 hp. losing a party member means losing a quarter of total damage. however, in this game, joker dying isnt an instant game over. to lose, *every* party member has to die, not just the protag. if the character you're playing is low on health, switch to another. the ai will automatically keep them away from danger (mostly) and you can get back to fighting.\n\nyou start the game with joker, then unlock everybody else at once so it can be kind of overwhelming. every character is fairly well balanced so just play whoever you like most. i use ann and yusuke often because they're fast and do quick damage, but if you prefer more hard hitting characters ryuji and haru are a good choice. sophie and makoto are both a moderate between those. you unlock 'arts' while playing a character, which gives them new moves and other helpful stuff. once you've unlocked all of a character's arts, its good to switch to a new one so that you can have a party thats all boosted!\n\nin the game, confidants are replaced by a bond level. when your bond levels up you get bond points, which you can use to get upgrades. i highly recommend 'strength boost', which increases everyone's physical attack damage (essentially 90% of the damage you'll be doing), as well as ambusher and oracle recovery, which both restore hp after battles.\n\nfusion accidents happen CONSTANTLY, i dont know if its just my bad luck or something but it feels like 1 out of every 5 is an accident, so don't get too attached to whatever you're fusing.\n\nanyways its a really fun game!!!!! play it!!!!!!!!!!!",

Tweaking it in the nVidia control panel fixes it completely and makes the game a wonder on the eyes. It's a shame that it has to be done, though, since that probably means the port quality is scrappier than I would've liked, but at least it's a relatively small and easy thing to tweak.\n\nOtherwise, the game's pretty solid so far. I'm surprised at how \"Persona\" it is, since I was certain that it was gonna be a Warriors game, with stages and missions, that just happens to have a Persona skin. Much to my surprise, it's not. I mean, it's certainly a Warriors' game, but not a 1:1 skin.\n\nEDIT: Also, remake Persona 3 and put it on PC pls.",

So far it has been a blast. My biggest problem is that the game has crashed 4 times on me but I save constantly so I only lost like 5 minutes total. Another problem I have is that I am not a fan of how the fusion menu is organized, you cannot select two Personas to slap them together but instead you have to find the two you want in the menu, and I feel like sometimes you can't fuse two together while in all the other games you can slap basically any two together to get something (obviously some trio combinations don't make anything in other games). \n\nDo not buy if you have a Windows 7 computer, the game will NOT open.\n\nput P3FES and Royale on PC so I can buy them again.",

Helped me make sense of things that I couldn't beforehand, therefore this series means a lot to me and because of the characters and themes of course :D \n\nPS: Synchronicity is my most favorite theory :)\n\nAnyways, the game does an amazing job catering to fans and the story does a better job at pulling your heart strings than the main game. Its amazing how the songs only get better and better with each new release :P Also, the cinematic after clearing the puzzles and then defeating hordes of enemies (especially if u play on hard mode) in the first jail is pure HYPE.",

But that's once the massive influx of bugs gets fixed.\nRandom crashes every two or three loading screens, black screen on cutscenes, infinite load times, controllers suddenly making constant 360's on the camera, and audio breaks are some of the most common bugs the game is experiencing as of 23/02/2021.\nMy review will almost surely change once I get to play more than 30 minutes without it crashing into desktop, but as of now, it stands in the negative.\nTo anyone thinking about buying the game, please make sure the bugs are mostly dealt with before doing so.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, they fixed almost all bugs, took them around two months after launch to do it, but they fixed them.\n\nGame's good, it feels like an OVA of the original P5. They flesh out the team members a little bit more, and they again reinforce with strength that Ryuji is -in fact- the goodest boy.\nMechanics-wise, they managed to be as faithful to the original as much as the musou format allowed them, which is amazing given the vast difference between gameplays.\nThe game kinda becomes weaker story-wise the more it gets closer to the end, but it's fair to assume it's still got passing grades on this regard.\nIt's a pretty good game overall. \nA shame the post-game doesn't have too much to fiddle around once you beat it, but it's a good buy.",

So far in the little bit I have played I really enjoy the combat although different from previous titles, but it is a nice change to see persona combat like this. The story so far is amazing in my opinion and it does reference the first game but not so much that you can't get into the new title and love the characters as they are presented here. I can't wait to see what atlus has in store, and hopefully we will get Persona 5 Royal on pc soon which I think we will considering that day one this game is doing so well on pc, but that is just my theory",

        "content": "Game initially was a good homage to Persona 5 but soon became apparent it was not going to follow well in its footsteps. The game starts of strong with a strong opening and good display of the mechanics and gameplay but as you progress through the game you realise it is just a dynasty game. \n\nUnfortunately the game lacks substance. Its all combat oriented but even that is shoddy at best. The story within this game is extremely lack-lustre compared to its predecessors. The amount of actual story in this game is questionable at best. With the removal of confidants and making dialogue scenes more and more scarce there is no actual character development.\n\nThe game is also bugged. Even on a good rig the game still runs slowly and at one point the \ngame would soft lock you from continuing. To remedy this I had to try multiple methods that were convoluted just to progress. The gameplay at times can also feel clunky as its lock on camera and obstacles make it so that you character doesn't move freely or how you want.\n\nOverall the game isn't worth the price tag. Get it on sale. Or just play Royal. It has the content of a side story not a sequel so it is far overpriced. Overall if the bugs were fixed the story is just compelling enough for a P5 fan to want to play but it is not worthy of being a sequel as it lacks the substance Persona 5 had.",

        "content": "No Kasumi, but the new characters Sophia and Zenkichi are pretty cool. Dialogue is funny, but has its cringe moments, so classic Persona.\n\nHow turn-based Persona mechanics would translate to the Warriors style gameplay was what I was most interested in when I heard about Scramble, and having put a good amount of time into Strikers, I can say that it flows together near seamlessly. There's a bit of a learning curve, I died a fair amount on the first few bosses, but once you get a feel for the flow of combat, you can string together some nasty combos. This made the second major boss feel like a cakewalk in comparison, not because it was easier in difficulty, but because I knew how to use my SP and movement more effectively. I'm near the end of the third \"dungeon\" and this pattern has continued. XP and money grinding is always available, and when the game says leaving the dungeon has no downside, it means there's literally no downside. Just wait like 1 minute for the cutscenes, then reenter to find all your SP refilled. This all makes it so that even if you suck like I did at first, you can still progress through brute force, though learning the mechanics is your best bet, as that one minute of Mementos' \"woahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoah\" cutscenes will get annoying.\n\nDefinitely a worthwhile pickup for fans of P5, and one of the best Warriors-style games I've played.",

        "content": "****THIS GAME IS A SEQUEL TO PERSONA 5, NOT PERSONA 5 ROYAL. KASUMI IS NOT IN THIS GAME****\n\nPersona 5 was an instant Playstation classic. SMT/Persona has been around for awhile and PC gamers are finally getting exposed to it. Last year Persona 4 was the highest selling Non-MMO JRPG of all time on Steam. This game may be the first of it's genre in the persona series, but it is doing is perfectly.\n\nIt takes a second to get used to, that is for sure, especially if you're coming right off of P5. But holy heck yall, it is good. I have been craving more Phantom Thieves since I beat P5, and this game finally lets the whole cast come together as an ensemble from the beginning, rather than slowly adding them.\n\nThis game has no romance or social links. It instead has the Bond system which is just a few passives for leveling another set of EXP which you get from pretty much doing anything related to your friends. I have been told you can still go on a date though with your waifu of choice, which of course, should be Haru. Axe Wife best Wife.\n\nBuy this game. You will not regret it.",

        "content": "I beat the game not too long ago, and I have to say this:\n\nAs someone who played Persona 5 original and Royal prior to this, it is a step down story wise. That's not saying it's a bad story line, but it is rather similar and some parts are lifted from the original games. I'll put anything spoil related at the far bottom so if anyones not played, they can't see it. My pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-The combat is FANTASTIC. Going into this, I had a hard time getting used to it, because I was used to the slower combat from Persona 5, but this... hits so hard, literally. The combat feels so heavy, and that in my personal opinion makes games like this great. \n-The dialogue is cheesy at times, but there are so many moments that I laughed my ass off due to comedic timing, and just Yusuke being Yusuke. There are many screenshots I hold dearly from this game of the dialogue. \n-The music is OUTSTANDING. I remember hearing River in the Desert for the first time in Persona 5, and I remember how badass it sounded. But they literally looked at the original soundtrack, took the best songs and said: \"Hey, let's make this more kickass\". Believe it or not, it's more kickass. Rivers in the Desert, Last Surprise and most importantly, Daredevil, the 3rd version of Life will Change if you will. These songs made this game SO good, because you felt the pressure, and high tension. I listen to these songs out of game, they're that good. Also Sophia's shop's theme SLAPS.\n-The art style is so good. The cities you visit feel like a snapshot from real life and pasted into this game with a hint of that really colorful Persona style. \n-The bosses are actually really good. Usually in a game like this, there are a lot of lackluster bosses and the mini bosses are easy and boring. But they did something really interesting with the Request system, where later in the game, you can get requests to beat the boss of the city again, beat really powerful shadows around the area, or just farm. Personally speaking, I liked the Warden system, which are essentially mini bosses before the main boss. They give you a feel for the \"villain\", and give them character, which makes a good antagonist. (Sapporo boss is a meme tho, it's honestly funny to play, but fun)\n-Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are AMAZING. The devs took the idea of All-Out Attacks from the original game and pumped it with CRACK. When you see the way it's used in Persona 5 and can find it a little confusing on how you implement it in this game, and I was there at the beginning, but they managed to make it incredibly smooth, which kind of ties into the combat part, but this is separated because there will never be a better feeling than having finishing a strong shadow off with Ryuji leading an All-Out Attack and finishing it with: \"S E E  Y A ! !\"\n-The fact that you can play as the other characters is so amazing. Ambushing enemies as Yusuke, him saying \"I shall expose you.\" in the most composed matter, man, you can't ask for better.\n-THE GAME DOESN'T END IF JOKER DIES!!\n-Level design is SUPERB. This does tie with the art style aspect, but I just have to shout out how good the Shibuya level looks and sounds. The music and levels work SO well. \n-The new characters are so good man, I can't express how much I love Zenkichi. The way he plays off the rest is so natural and hilarious. Sophia is adorable and we must protect her. \n-It is mandatory to bring up Ryuji saying the F word. (Fun fact, the F word is used twice in this entire game, once by Ryuji, and once by a flashback shadow)\n-They started using 3D cutscenes and they are amazing, please do that more often Atlus.\n\nCons:\n-The animation is a liiitle weird at times. My main issue with this is how lifeless everyone looks when they're chilling in the van or just in cutscenes. At times it was just funny how their blank expressions would never change when they would chant \"Yeah! Let's infiltrate this jail!\". \n-The story is a little strange. It is a typical JRPG at times and it reeeally shows. I'll continue my thoughts further down. \n-The music is a little loud when you first launch the game, and you can't change it if you start a new game after a while of cut scenes, which leads me into my next point:\n-There are a little too many cut scenes at times. It was clear that there were a lot of shortcuts taken with cut scenes and how they skip around. I know this is a nitpick, but with how good this game is, that's really what it comes to. \n-The combat *can* get repetitive, but if you really think about it, that's the same case with Persona 5, but this game is about 40 hours shorter than the original. \n-I did mention earlier that the dialogue is amazing, but there was some dialogue that made me cringe. But then again, it's a typical JRPG in that regard. They could have cut down on how many times they say ones name when that particular person is upset or expressing something. \n-I don't know if this is just me, but I had issues with crashing. There were many times in my play through that I would beat a boss, relieved, then mid cut scene, the game would freeze and then crash. \n-The limited supplied for cooking is frustrating, but I totally understand why they did that, because cooked items are *busted* if you save them for future battles. \n\nShould you play Persona 5 before this? Yes. \n\nIs it necessary? No, but it is highly recommended, due to a lot of references to the previous games (except Maruki, like what) \n\nIs this game worth the price? Yes. I know that's up for debate, but honestly, you can get a *lot* of hours in this game, which is what makes games worth their price. If I'm being honest, I could've spent up to 70-80 hours if I 100%ed it, but I every request except the Prison mails. \n\nIs Deluxe worth it? As someone who purchased the deluxe, I will say that it's not necessarily worth the extra $10, but it is nice to be able to change your battle music and see art for the game. \n\n10/10 Game. \n\n*SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT*\n\n\n\n\n\n-The story is verrrrry similar to Persona 5, in the sense that you fight a god, again. I kind of see why they did that, but it was rather recycled, due to EMMA looking extremely similar to the final boss from P5. Was it fun? Yes, the only reason really is the aspect of splitting everyone into three groups to finish EMMA off. I will give kudos to that, which is a good idea for a final boss. I will say this: The cut scene of everyone finishing off EMMA in an All-Out Attack, is SO good. Everyone got proper screen time, including Haru. \n-Sophia going with Ichinose is so wholesome, it made my heart feel good :)\n-Zenkichi catching Owada is so heartwarming :)",

This game often references the past story/game and does not go out of its way to tell you wtf happened in the first game (you should play it tho, it's really good). The combat is much less Dynasty Warriors than anticipated on my part, it's deep and kinda challenging, especially at bosses. It's very story driven, so if long cutscenes bore you, you might aswell skip that game because this game does contain a lot of story only times with no gameplay at all.",

        "content": "10/10 game, now keep it up and bring the rest of the Persona franchise to PC.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a step in a brand new direction for the entire Persona franchise, yet entirely fits all of the knowledge we currently have on the series. Every single translation of a skill from the JRPG format to the Dynasty Warriors format makes complete sense. The combat system feels incredible and flows perfectly with the styles of all of the Phantom Thieves, each of the Thieves' fighting style perfectly matching their character. The game also encourages you to use all of the Phantom Thieves (and no spoilers, you should it helps later on), beyond just using them to hit weaknesses.  The game may feel difficult, as bosses can have an insane amount of health if you don't have maxed equipment or the best Personas, but remember that the game encourages you to spend a lot of time in the Jails and that unlike the original Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal: [b]You can re-enter a Jail as many times as you want on a single day, refreshing your HP/SP every single time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nThe story is entertaining, and the new characters are welcome additions to the Persona 5 cast. The new Phantom Thieves fit incredibly well with the others, and their additions to the cast prove that it's not just high school kids who can change reality. There's a good balance of comedy relief with serious plot points, and the game knows when to take itself in either direction. Without spoilers, the late-game stuff can get incredibly emotional if you're invested, and again fits with the rest of the series while trying something new. \n\n[h1]Voice Actors/Thank You[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is the English VA's. You can tell that every single one of them was having a blast in the recording studio, and became the Phantom Thieves [sttrike]more than any cringy fan on social media ever could[/strike]. It wasn't as obvious to me in Persona 5/Royal, but in this game it was clear that every single voice actor was having a blast and completely invested in their characters, which was something that couldn't necessarily be given during a first game in a series like P5/P5R. As the characters grew, so did the VA's and it really showed in this game. To the English Cast, thank you for an incredible performance, and can't wait for the next one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, wait for P5/P5R to come out on PC if you haven't played them already, or play it on PS4 since it's out there now. Persona 5 Strikers was an incredible experience that I can't wait to play over and over again to 100% and the point where I have every Persona completely maxed out. I'm incredibly happy to see that ATLUS doesn't need to make a JRPG to have an incredible entry into the Persona franchise.",

        "content": "The Phantom Thieves are back, just in a different way than fans of the series are used to. \n\nThey've been given the Musou treatment to resemble a dynasty warriors game, at least with combat. And the dungeons have also been simplified to match the new gameplay style, while retaining jokers ability to switch persona on the fly and some element of party management and group control / move selection in order to retain the persona series feeling, however has ripped away the confidant system to be replaced by \"bonds\", which are upgrade-able by the player at any point, each providing its own unique buff. \n\nThe game does try to introduce new ideas like this, however the concept is still the same as in previous games with antagonists becoming corrupted enough to create their own alternate reality. However there's a slight change here which allows the Jail Monarch to control people in the real world, forcing the Phantom Thieves to travel around Japan to stop them.\n\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers isn\u2019t as compelling or thought provoking as its predecessors, yet the game is filled with fan service, and numerous references to the characters backstories and events from previous games, which for fans of the series is excellent and not forced, however for newcomers to the series will be just a tad confusing as none of them are explained. \n\nIt looks amazing retaining its slick punchy style and surreal colour schemes, each cutscene and special move have been choreographed carefully to capture each character's personality. In this regard Strikers still feels very much like a Persona game and hasn\u2019t lost any of its charm, with voice acting to match, it's hard to call this a spin-off, clearly time and effort was taken with this rather than just being a money grab. \n\nOverall, although it's shifted from its winning JRPG formula, the gameplay, narrative, story line and combat are all well worth playing through the 30 (ish) hour campaign for, however only for fans of the series, i'd generally say this is an awful entry point for new players, and to pick up p4 and p5 first.",

DLC packs for battle music enriches the game's already wonderful music.\n\nGameplay wise. it's definitely an interesting departure from turn-based combat. the persona fusion and real time hack and slash certainly spices things up.\n\nHighly recommend this game.",

        "content": "So I've seen a lot of great reviews, so this may just be a me issue but I need to mention it anyways because I love this game and want it to succeed as I have genuinely enjoyed it since fixing this issue on my own. \n\nThe control-scheme was very non-intuitive for the way they had it set up for people using mouse & keyboard. It doesn't play very smooth at all and I spent a pretty significant amount of time in the key-bindings menu trying to get things squared away. The issue was that there are so many commands, but the keyboard & mouse setup is designed as if you're just playing with keyboard, so the same buttons used to for left and right mouse are in the immediate area of WASD. This would be fine, if it didn't \"push\" other important commands to further locations from my hand on the keyboard, causing me to have to adjust my hand placement on the keyboard pretty regularly during fights until I changed the settings.\n\nThis isn't something that makes me regret getting the game, and I absolutely LOVE it now that I've adjusted things. Super fun and entertaining successor to the original game. \n\n*Minor Spoiler*\n\nJust wanted knew players to be aware of this concern I had because the beginning of the game is heavy on combat tutorials. So even though it was guiding me how to play, it doesn't change the ease by which you can actually play. This detracted from my ability to fully dive into the introductory plot. Something that I definitely think the company should attempt to update in the future or at least learn from for future games.",

Other than this the game runs perfectly smooth at 1080 and 60fps High without the need of a really powerful graphics card, so it's an easy buy if you have the recommended specs for it.

        "content": "[h1]-Overall Opinion-[/h1]\n\nThis is genuine Persona DNA through and through, even though the combat system is different. If you go in with an open mind you'll be pleasantly surprised with what they've done here. While it won't have a great level of tactical depth as a turn based Persona game, stringing combos together, pausing the action for a moment to bring out your persona and use an ability, it's all very seamless and well done. I'm enjoying the game so far, it really is a bonafide Persona 5 sequel (not Persona 5 Royal sequel). \n\n[h1]-Story-[/h1]\nI am 18 hours in so this is an initial impression. The premise here is fine, we are basically moving themes from corrupt adults doing whatever they want to fulfill their own selfish desire to social media being a bad influence on young adults and making them do awful things to get over their complex and escape the judgement of their peers. Perhaps at the end of this there will be an in-depth commentary on the effect of social media on our collective psyche. It is serviceable enough in retaining attention, however, without going into explicit spoilers, I do find the recycling of some of the motives that compel the phantom thieves to do what they do to be frustrating. \n\n[h1]-Graphics-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Very Stylized \u2705\n    [*]Supports up to 4K \u2705\n    [*]Borderless, full-screen, windowed options \u2705\n    [*]Some text does not scale well at high resolutions \u274c\n    [*]Limited graphical options (bloom, motion blur, AA, AO, textures, shadows) \u274c\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]-Performance-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Runs smooth \u2705\n    [*]Potato friendly \u2705\n    [*]Coin toss on if you'll play 4 hours without a single crash or one hour and crash 2 times.

Definitely worth it.\nHowever do only buy if you have played P5 or P5R as this game is the successor, and without knowledge of P5/P5R you don't know who these guys are, why they have a talking cat and what their story is.\n\nTo those who played P5/P5R: Buy it full price or discount, your decision. Gameplay is different than the original, but fun.\nAlso it's a bit more action oriented. Plus you do not need to bond with your friends like you had to in the first game. I personally would have had more fun if it was more like P5/P5R, but I would lie, if I say I don't like it.\n\nGreat game.\n\nPS: Hope I will find P5/P5R on Steam as well someday.",

        "content": "After 36 hours in I can safely say that this is not the Persona 5 experience I was hoping to get. The best thing about Persona 5 was how it blended together two different genres in one - JRPG and school simulator. Here you only have one genre - hack and slash with a little bit of RPG thrown in. This means that most of the time you will be doing the same things and that is it. And if you are not into the story, you will be left burned out from the experience. \n\nOn the plus side I was pleasantly surprised that the iconic style of Persona 5 has been implemented into the new gameplay and locations. Also, the story is captivating and imaginative like in the past instalments and I do love the road-trip-in-the-summer vibe. The characters stay true to themselves and there are plenty of funny and touching moments with them. Not surprisingly the music is a blast and I do like that through DLC you may get the remastered versions of the previous games' battle music to play during the combat. Finally, the addition of cooking was a nice touch as well. Yes, there is sort of a cooking mechanic in the original P5, but here you need to first unlock the meal through a recipe, which can be collected in various ways, and then you need to gather the needed materials to prepare the meal as well.  \n\nWhere Persona 5 Strikers disappoints is in the core gameplay, environments and playability. While interesting at first, the hack-and-slash quickly becomes boring and predictable, even if it uses the weakness and Persona systems from P5. I prefer the turn-based combat as there the gameplay did not feel the same even after 100 hours in. You got the negotiations, the all-out-attacks and ambushes were more meaningful, the single vs all spells were more distinctive from one another, which Persona you had with you was more crucial. Here the gameplay practically boils down to casting spells, to which the enemies are weak, until you get to all-out-attack. Everything else has been simplified way too much. You can heal and restore SP via items at any time without any repercussions. Futaba tells you the weakness of the enemy in the beginning of the fight - bosses as well. You do not need to take down every single enemy to trigger an all-out-attack. Also, there was something terrifying and at the same special when you had to face off several enemies at once in the original P5. Here, because there are literally hordes of enemies sometimes you won't even notice some of them and they will soon all blend in together. \n\nThe jails, themselves, have kept the unique environments from Persona 5 and they are not simply hallways. However, the feeling is the same as the one in Persona 4 - you go to a jail, do the same thing and end up in the same spot over and over again. There are no intricate puzzles, no surprise roadblocks or challenges. The formula is so far the same and thus, the locations feel the same, even if they are unique in their environments. The locations are also not exempt from this - sure, you will see plenty of Japanese cities, but essentially what you are getting per city are two mini locations filled with the same convenience stores and vending machines. Also, you can not do any extra activities in the cities - it is all just roaming the same street several times, buying several items and then going back to the Jail. Sure, occasionally if you talk to a member of the Phantom Thieves they might give you a side quest, which involves more than simply going up and down the map. However, the quests, themselves, are nothing that special and the missed opportunity to have a different version of a mini-game in each city is surely missing. \n\nFinally, while I said that there are plenty of character moments you are not involved with the characters that much, apart from the main story. One of the strongest aspects of Persona 5 were the interactions you had with the Phantom Thieves and the confidants, which happened outside of the main narrative. In Persona 5 Strikers you only get some boring side quests (like I mentioned) and some lines regarding the city / the particular moment in the story. \n\nI feel like I would be in the minority of people, who expected more of the game and were left disappointed, but I had to write this review down for anybody like me, who felt in love in Persona 5 and were eagerly anticipating this game. And can you blame me - they made Persona 5 Strikers look like it is a sequel to Persona 5. Apart from the story, it is anything but a sequel. \n\n",

        "content": "Rollin back in here, still not done but hot damn this game does not stop. Does it slow down when it needs to? Yes.That said, I keep waiting for this game to become formulaic like its predecessor and it seems to be made specifically to prevent the player from getting complacent. Sure, there's a degree of predictability, but for the most part, it's a fun and unpredictable ride. \n\nWhat I've played of this combined with my experience with Astral Chain leads me to believe that, if Omega Force let themselves out of their own cage more often, they would easily outpace Platinum at their own strengths. Each game of theirs I've played since Dynasty Warriors 8 has begun to diverge further and further from the formula they used to strictly employ and it is completely for the better. Hyrule Warriors: Calamity was pretty good, but...I don't know if Atlus really knew how to draw their potential out of them or if they just were encouraged to just let loose and go wild but holy crap the gameplay feels great.\n\nCouple that with the soundtrack, which the mediocre tracks in this outpace some of the best tracks in the already stellar soundtrack Persona 5 had and you have a mixture for a game that frequently just hits the damn zenith for what an action game can make the player feel.\n\nAll that said, the game doesn't forget the series it's in. Many have said it's a love letter to fans of the series and it feels exactly like that. The plot builds on the characters they spent over 100 hours feeding us backstory and introducing to us, and Strikers serves to just show us how all of them have grown, both individually and as a group of friends who haven't seen each other for a year, but still kept in touch.\n\nI could honestly go on longer but I think the point is made, and I'd rather not spoil anything.",

        "content": "TDLR; Very fun gameplay but has only a decent story that gets the job done, has tedious grinding, and some pc port issues. \n\n\nBefore I start there're a few things I'd like to note. PLEASE for the love of god wait for a patch. Now that I've been playing for longer the more and more issues I've been having with the pc version. It crashes often, leading me to lose progress, I've lost around 4 hours of progress in total which has been extremely infuriating. [b][EDIT: This issue has been resolved in the latest beta hotfix][/b]Performance has had dips, while not constant they're noticeable. The settings that come with the game do almost nothing, so i had to go into Nvidia control panel to make AA myself. At this point I cannot progress through one of the last jails because of a loading screen that makes my game crash each time. I do recommend the actual game but don't buy right now, will edit if there is a fix. \n\nHere's the actual review:\n\nWow ok I am pleasantly surprised by this game. At first I was worried about it being another generic warriors game but I looked into the game more and it looked more like a Persona game than warriors which is the case. So if you're worried about that, don't be. I've also been surprised of how big the jails are, you can run around them freely for the most part except from a few linear sections and minor puzzles.\n\nThe combat is so fluid. It incorporates almost all elements of Persona 5 in one way or another. You can pause time and use specials to hit an enemies weakness and then all out attack is just as satisfying as it was in Persona 5, whilst not as flashy.  Baton passes, 1 mores, buffs/debuffs, futaba support all make their way into the game as well. Fusing personas and using them in battle is still in the game, but not as expanded, which is fine and I only noticed a few times after forgetting. You can blast through the game for a lot of it but with minimal effort except the boss fights, the difficulty scaling is a little whacky. \n\nThe story is worse than Persona 5 but it does have its charm. The story feels like a copy and paste for the first 2 jails but kind of picks up around the fourth jail, which I'm glad it did. The layout of the first two jails also feel similar which i'm confused by since they are supposed to be different. For what the story is overall, it's decent enough to warrant another journey with the phantom thieves.\n\nSome misc. gripes I have with the game is that you never have enough SP so SP items are essential though they're hard to get in large quantity, but you can leave and re enter the jail with no penalty. The grinding in this game is so unnecessarily shitty for late game personas, it requires much lower level personas to reach a threshold in level before you fuse them. How do you level them up? Persona Points which are given in low quantities and increase the amount needed to level up a persona each time, this made completing the registry worse than in vanilla Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Camera can also be whacky but isn't a huge deal.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 8/10.",

The gameplay is still standard Persona 5, sneaking around ambushing enemies and doing all out attacks, but this time hack and slash instead of turn-based battles.\n\nThis game can be seen as a direct sequel to Persona 5, not the Royal version, and several references from the previous game can be found and it makes me so happy seeing those, so if you haven't played Persona 5 before chances are some jokes, and sentences might go over your head.\n\nAnyways buy this game, show Atlus how many people want Persona on PC, cuz' I don't have the money for a PS5 once Persona 6 eventually rolls out, and more people need to experience this game series.\n\nFutaba Best Girl, don't @ me.",

If you haven't played Persona 5 or Royal I recommend you play that first, because there's a connection to the original P5 and this game did not explain it, so you have to know the lore. Combat mechanics are surprisingly refreshing and fun. I am a big fan of old turn based Persona game, but the new mechanics are definitely worth the try. I came across multiple crashes when I play this game for more than 3 hours so watch out and save the game every time you can. Maybe the developers will fix this in the near future. Now I can finally be happy and wait for Royal port to PC :)",

And that a good thing. \nThe combat is fun and is solid musou action.\n\nthe world feels like a blend between musou and persona, open maps with parts to jump on or a city to explore and investigate. You wont get bored of the character interactions and when you enter the jail you can go where you want. Sneak up to a enemy and start the combat in a closed up environment that fixes the open musou combat from other Koei titles. Its more like a Jrpg.\n\nGraphics are great and the soundtrack is just phenominal. \nI have a lot of praise for this title and you should get it as fan of the series, Jrpgs or musou titles.\nits a perfect blend.\n\nNow sadly the game is not the best port. Long loading screens and sadly crashes.\nplus people having issues with fps and you cant play in full screen atm. (windowed works perfect).\n\nWith that said, i know they will fix it over time. And i'm here to review the game itself.\nIts a fantastic title.\n\nEnjoy the game !!",

That's Persona 5 Striker but Haru's here and you're off to a roadtrip.\n\nGameplaywise it's looks like a musou and standard attacks are musou like, however it plays more like an action RPG in the same vein as the FF7 remake, if not faster and more busy on screen.\n\nTrash mob is trash so you can musou however you want, instead the big meat is on mini-boss and boss fight where your standard musou square-triangle combo will never work because you'll get hit before finishing it,\n\nIn those case you'll go back to the gameplay of a Megaten game, where you'll use buff and debuffs (r), hit weakness using persona and keep yourself healed, all of this to break shields and initiate an all out attacks.\n\nHowever this time, unlike the turn base of a Megaten/Persona, you'll be actively dodging the boss attack in the arena while switching characters and using special moves granted by environmental objects.\n\nKeep in mind that's it's a full sequel to P5 (it doesn't explicitly show everything about P5 plot/endgame but you are expected to know the characters, their background,personality etc, so yeah it's not a point of entry game) , loading are a bit long even on SSD, and there's some weird issues with anti aliasing that makes the text ugly (removing it fixes that but the characters models in the menu will have jagged edges, it's totally fine in gameplay tho)\n\n",

Sure, there are some references and topics that fly over my head, but the game does a good enough job explaining the previous situation.  The music slaps, scenery and art style is amazing, and the characters themselves are very funny and interesting.  Yusuke is so extra that I smile every time he talks.  \n\nGameplay wise, the combat is so much fun.  I much prefer this over the fighting style of P4 (and I suppose P5 as well).  I love zooming around jails and jumping on things.  I also like the bonding system that P5S offers, once again, I prefer this over the individual character bonding that was in P4.  \n\nShould you play P5S before playing P5? In my opinion: sure, why not?  You may spoil yourself and not pick up on every reference or joke, but the combat and story is awesome and I highly recommend it.",

And I've just had to sit on it, screaming on the  inside.\n\nBut ATLUS you delivered. Not only did you release this gorgeous addition to the Phantom Thieves narrative, but you did it on PC too!\n\nNow do it for Royal, I left my PS4 back in the home country. All I'm asking is the chance to buy your games more!\n\n(Also Makoto is the best.)",

I had the chance to play it on PS in the Japanese version and loved it, so it's amazing to see that Atlus is finally releasing Persona games on PC, because they\u00b4re truly amazing. \nI'm also surprised on how well optimized this game is. Atlus learned from their previous ports and managed to release a pretty great port with no performance issues so far and smooth experience, even when playing with a keyboard. The only problem I've faced so far was a crash after like 2 hours of gameplay.\nAlso, love the fact that you can change the battle theme to other Persona themes like P3P or P4.",

        "content": "I played persona 5 and I'm pretty much the main character but in real life, so I decided to try out things he did to make friends and get girlfriends. I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

I would've probably played this game a lot more if the support for xbox controllers wasn't so mediocre. All in all this game is really enjoyable and the way the story is going I'm probably going to replay it a few times. \nEDIT: It's just that I didn't have my controller connected to steam, it works now.",

New amazing music and remixes, industry leading style and the kind of character building everyone loves about the Persona series. If one likes the action based or the traditional turn based combat more is a matter of taste. \n\nThe few critical points are the fact that the story arc of P5 Royal is ignored within the game and that nearly all confidants from the base game are missing. (For real, I was so hyped to see Iwai again)\n\nSo, should you play this game?\nIf you played Persona 5 and liked it at least a bit: YES\nIf you haven't played Persona 5: Go get P5 (or P5R) for 20 bucks, have 100 very entertaining hours of gameplay and then come back and play this game.\n\nThanks bye",

The main game of Persona 5 will need to be played to understand the world, but this is nothing but a benefit since the game doesn't need to waste any time exploring the old cast. The story is very fun, the new characters are very welcome additions, the gameplay is addictive, and the soundtrack of course is godly.

        "content": "Sequels don't work, at least most of the time. Spin-offs are bad, at least as a general rule. And then, along came Persona 5 Strikers, which serves as much of a spin-off as a sequel. It is by no means a perfect game, no game is perfect, but this is goddam near it. Atlus could have re-skinned a warriors game whit Persona, and i would have bought it. Instead, what i got was a love letter to both, the Phantom Thieves and the Players. \n\nThis carries over a great deal of Persona 5. While some elements are shaved due to mechanics, most of them evolved with the gameplay change. Confidants are replaced by a bond system, you generate bond points trough certain requests or by fighting along characters. As expected the buffs from bonds are geared towards action games, more damage, faster bond growth, etc. At the same time this serves as a much friendlier system to the player, while still advances the narrative and deepens the bond between characters with the random personal request.\nAll the over the top action and showtimes are still present, and i must say, they are one of my favorite animations from the game, Atlus really brought out the personality of each Phantom Thieve trough this silly little animations. The combat itself feels fluid and gratifying, if at times a bit repetitive killing random trash. But where the game really shines is trough their boss fights. This has one of my favorite Boss encounters of the saga, and i thought it was nearly impossible to beat Futaba's Palace Boss. It could still use a bit more information on screen, like the direction and the type of incoming attacks from outside the screen, but it is by no means a deal breaker.\n\nThe downside to this game is, if you have not played Persona 5 OG you will probably feel left out on most of the conversations. A lot of references and inside jokes are beautiful winks to veterans of the saga, but might flew over the head of those not familiar with the lore, and i must say, this might lower your enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall i will say, give this game a change if you are a fan of Persona 5, if you haven't played Persona 5 yet, i will still recommend buying this one, as it is a very good warriors like game, and despite the random reference you might miss, the game does a very good job at exploring the characters and the narrative is A+ as i have come to expect from Atlus.\n\nPros\n\n++Combat is fluid and rewarding\n++Graphics are BEAUTIFUL\n++4k 60fps\n++Controls are very good and have a variety of schemes\n++More P5 and Phantom Thieves\n++Story Rich as any other Persona/Shin Megami\n\nCons\n\n--Heavy loaded with references and inside jokes (not necessary to enjoy the game, but you do miss some of the enjoyment)\n--No TIa Takemi ( SRSLY NGGS where is ma TIA)\n--Somewhat short (about 40-50ish hours depending on how fast you rush it)\n--No costumes DLC (yes for this game, that is a Con, trust me on this one)\n\nAll in all, if you are a P5 fan this is a 9/10, if you are not, this is easy an 8/10. Buy it now!!",

The crash also didn't effect me basically in anyway because I saved before. I enjoyed every moment of this game, the story and game play is just amazing.  I loved the combat, and like I said the story is just amazing. Overall this game is a 10/10. Zenkichi and Sophia are legends (Even though the game a bit on the shorter end, I still think its worth buying).",

I have played though this endlessly and i love this game, I love hack and slashes, I love persona games. This was a great combination of the two.. but.. My issue lies with how the SP is limited. While yes we don't have a time limit the check points feel a little to far apart.. so at times you may need to switch out party members and you may be stuck with a member who is at a major disadvantage for that section and if that character also doesn't have healing it can screw you over if your not good at this type of game. Its not Horrible but if you need to get outta there, and there's a story boss or need to take an enemy out so you can get to the checkpoint it can be nerve racking, and there isn't a lot of sp items.. but its all manageable with enough skill and yeah its still addicting.. and i'm almost done yeah i'm almost done the game i think.. so its also short but still very VERY fun pick the game up, steal hearts again and if you have anyway to play the original game (PLAY THAT FIRST PLEASE IF YOU CAN) play it and play this, i hope we can actually get one more game with this cast as i love them a lot and hopefully you will too.",

It's a hack-and-slash after all and all you are doing is just hitting random buttons and kill every enemy that is in your line of sight. Some fights will require you to use skills more carefully, such as bosses and dire shadows, but those aren't really that difficult as well, even on Hard difficulty.\n\nStory-wise, it's standard. It follows the same story/plot of Persona 5 so nothing has really changed much in this game.\n\nI only have 5 hours in this game and only just completed story 1. Game is really enjoyable so far and I will be sure to complete the game!",

Have a few random game crash when loading screen to another area that could lead to frustration as the game don't have auto save feature.Not sure if The game itself or Nvidia Driver,as right now no support driver release for this game.BTW artwork and music is superb.Recommended especially for Persona fans.Story could be kind of confuse for newcomer as the original Persona 5 only available on PS4.

Sure, there are still mindless waves of fodders for you to smash them away, but they also implement tactical RPG stuff really nicely. You will find yourself planning the fight surprisingly a lot more than that. Most systems from Persona series are coming back and fit in really nicely (Elemental weakness, One-more, All-out-attack, Showtime.) It feels not out of place and keep it very true to the lore of Persona 5 in every aspect from gameplay, design, theme, and world's logic.\n\nOne thing that can be see as a downside is P5S is the direct continuation of Persona 5 (with some references to P5R too.) And it's not a small side story but pretty much a full fledged saga. They do try to rush out some of quick recap in the first hour but people without experience of  Persona 5 can find this sudden insertion to technical stuff too absurd for them. Is it needed? Not really. But your reaction would be \"Oh! I remember that! Nice!\" every thirty seconds to \"WTF just happened?\" based on your exposure to Persona franchise. Still a great game, but ATLUS and SEGA should really considered boosting this game with the Persona 5 Royal release on PC.",

But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus ! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is probably the best \"Warriors\" game ever made.\n---\nYou play as Joker, a person with the Wild Card ability, which is a pass for using multiple Personas in the franchise. You and Morgana returned to Tokyo for your summer vacation, after planning for a barbecue with your friends, you were suddenly thrown into the Metaverse once more...\n---\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe combat is a combination of both Warriors-series by Omega Force and Persona-series, although it's a lot more similar to \"Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon\", with the fluidity and mobility of \"Warriors\" combat. You'll still primarily press a series of buttons to execute your attacks and strong attacks, however, you can also pause in-combat to use your Persona skills or recovery items.\nEach character, Persona, and enemy have their own kit, strength, and weaknesses. The way abilities are used by enemies will vary for each type of enemy, for example, Mara's \"One-Shot Kill\" would send a barrage of bullets towards the enemy (and 'stains' you for some reason), while Seth's \"One Shot Kill\" would be an explosion. This variation makes for a unique encounter for each enemy. You can obtain Personas by defeating them in the battlefield, or by fusing two (or more) Personas in the Velvet Room.\nThe hack-and-slash gameplay is vastly different than in other Warriors games. Each enemy will also have a \"Knockdown Gauge\" which, if depleted, will knock them down and enables \"1 More\" move and/or \"All-Out Attack\" for the player. You can deplete the gauge by dealing critical hits or striking the enemies' weaknesses. If the enemy still has \"Knockdown Gauge\", they won't stagger at all by your normal attacks, which lets them to counter your attacks by using abilities.\nYou can play as one of four characters that you choose before delving into a dungeon. Each character is actually fun to play, and each of them has certain characteristics in their movesets which are unique to them, which makes for a fun, different playstyle for each character -- something that is missing from modern Warriors games.\n-----\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAh, the story. Before the story starts, there was an phenomenon called the \"Change of Hearts\" epidemic in which some high-profile figures confessed to many scandals, the authorities ruled out the possibility that the Phantom Thieves are the perpetrator behind this phenomenon and started an investigation against them.\nBack to Joker and friends. After planning for a barbecue, they downloaded an app called EMMA, an artificial intelligence guide, which also doubles as an SNS app in which users can become friends with each other by sharing their \"keywords\". Turns out, some keywords will send people's Shadows to Jails within the Metaverse. With the Metaverse's return, Joker and the Phantom Thieves set out to solve the mystery behind it. Along the way, they were informed by a member of the authorities that the same phenomenon is currently happening in Sapporo, and the said member also asked the assistance of the Phantom Thieves to solve the case.\nThe Phantom Thieves decided that they would spend their summer vacation solving the mystery of the Jails and the Metaverse, while also having a road trip across various cities in Japan.\n---\nThe story is a generic slice-of-life anime story with a pinch of \"Shin Megami Tensei\", typical Persona games. The 3D cutscenes and incredible voice acting makes the story interesting enough for me, that I can endure a 40 minute-long series of cutscenes.\nBottom line, the story is pretty good, but the duration of the cutscenes are probably too long for some people.\n-----\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nIf you played both Warriors and Persona games, then you'll want to cross Easy and Normal out of your choices. Hard difficulty offers a tough but fair combat, and you'll risk of actually losing the battle.\nAfter you beat the game and beat the ultimate boss, you'll unlock a new difficulty for New Game+ called \"Merciless\". This difficulty will crank enemy status through the roof, even early Shadows like Pixies and Jack o' Lanterns will easily kill you. Hell, the tutorial Bicorn feels like Chaos-Lu Bu where you can be killed in two hits -- even if you're level 82 with high-tier Personas.\nSo yeah, go with Hard mode for the first playthrough, and choose Merciless for the second playthrough. At least you won't be too surprised by the difficulty jump in New Game+.\n-----\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nCrashes. I experienced more than 12 crashes in my first playthrough, it often happens after leaving the Velvet Room, whenever cutscene background changing drastically (for example, from inside LeBlanc to outside LeBlanc), and leaving dungeons. Some even happen in the middle of a series of cutscenes after a 10 minutes boss fight. I really hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else.\n------\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI had fun playing this game, 54 hours of hack-and-slash-plus-JRPG fun accompanied by an interesting and entertaining story -- makes for a game I would easily recommend to anyone. I hope that I can see another Strikers game again from Atlus and Omega Force.\n-----\nThat being said, please port Persona 5 Royal to PC, Atlus.",

        "content": "The unexpected persona game to say the least but ATLUS did a very good job of keeping this game, well... still in the theme of Persona.\n\n[h1] Combat Mechanics [/h1]\nTo be simple, Turn-based JRPG turn Real-Time.\nA lot combat aspects are still there, surprisingly. Exploit weaknesses, All-Out-Attack, Baton Pass.[b] THEY ARE ALL STILL THERE! [/b] I'm surprise of how they are manage to do that and make it work flawlessly. And the most exciting of all, the Showtime is just gorgeous!\n\n[h1] Everyday Mechanics [/h1]\nApart from the cut confidant, not a lot have change. You start by gather the information about the target  and then you go in the dungeon now call \"The Jail\" and then you go to a total nut job mode. Sometime do a request and spend time talking with teammates or inside the RV. Basically the game loop is that.\nBond system is the new one that they introduce in this game. Similar to Social Links/Confidant but instead of going to each teammates and get their abilities, you get points to upgrades which you will need them.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSince currently at the time of this review I have not finish the game yet and I know that no ones want a spoiler. So the only thing that I'm going to talking about is how they tell the story.\nThe story goes on like in the Persona 5, you notice that something is going on in Shibuya just when the Thieves are having a summer trip and later they know that the issue is going across the japan in various cities. The story has to deal with trauma of \"the Monarch\", the ruler of Jail, that works like a Palace [b]with a twist[/b].\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\nTalk about Persona without the music is [b]WRONG[/b].\nAlthough Shoji Meguro, ATLUS house composer, is not the composer in Persona 5 Striker, the music still an absolute banger! Sound effects overall is perfect.\nRight now I really dig \"Welcome To The Jail\", \"Counter Strike\", \"Axe To Grind\", \"You are Stronger\" and a lot more!\n\nTo be honest, the things that ATLUS did. This would be a bottom at my list of what ATLUS would do the their games and I have doubt at first about this being the Beat'em Up kind of game because I don't like this kind of game. But they really take my breath away here, got to give it to them.\n\n[h1]Some After Thought[/h1]\nWhat I said above is all true, this game is still a fantastic game and I urge anyone who interested in this game to play. HOWEVER, this game-by all means-still is not a traditional Persona experience. I still recommend mainline Persona more than this game overall. And since this is a beat 'em up game and this is a linear-story game, the replay-ability is next to none apart from the completionist gamer. So for me, the flaws of this game is really \"It's not normal Persona\" which is dumb. ATLUS did a thing that throw us off, and they done a fantastic job. The bitter opening of this paragraph will not effect my verdict.\n\nThis. is. still. fantastic.",

        "content": "Absolute brilliant game. If you have played and enjoyed Persona 5 you will want to play this. The story feels like a worthy Persona 5 sequel and the gameplay is the perfect mix of action and Persona gameplay. The combat does for Persona what FF7 Remake does for FF7.\n\nThe game is not without it's technical bugs which will hopefully be ironed out. I had multiple crashes and consistent freezes when zoning into one of the dungeons which needed to be waited out to continue. I was more than willing to overlook these issues and power through as the game is just really good and hard to put down.\n\nIf you haven't played Persona 5 However I would recommend holding off on playing this until you have. (Hopefully Persona 5 sees a Steam release at some point. Please Sega) The story does very little to explain what happened in the previous game as it presumes you already know the events. Which is a good and bad things as this doesn't really spoil the story of the original too much if you were to play this first, but might leave Strikers only players confused about what/who is being referenced at times. \n\nThis is a must play for Persona 5 players and for everyone else play both.",

        "content": "TLDR : A Refreshing take on the Persona franchise that actually works pretty well, with a few hiccups here and there. A solid game despite the lack of it's predecessor, P5 being on Steam (GIVE US P5R ON PC ATLUS / SEGA!) \n\nFull Review :\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes the traditional turn based combat gameplay of Persona and actually manages to make a pretty good hack'n'slash adaptation of it. Persona skills and all work well within a real-time environment, and you even have the ability to string them into combos for no SP cost too (SP is basically the \"mana\" of Persona, for the newcomers). \n\nThe game does have one major flaw though in it's execution, the lack of the social aspect of Persona. In the mainline Modern Persona games (Persona 3 FES / P3 Portable / Persona 4 Golden (it's on Steam too go buy it) / Persona 5 / P5R) you have a big focus on the social side of gameplay, interacting with your companions, potential romance options, etc., which tie into the dungeon crawling aspect of them by strengthening companions you have strong bonds too. None of that is present in Strikers here, which is a shame. \n\nStrikers is also much more linear than the mainline games. That's not to say the mainline games I'm comparing it too had multiple endings or anything (P4 had like 7, P5R had 4 or so if I remember right), but they had a TON of stuff mixed into the social side, such as choosing whether to go out with friends (strengthen bonds) or do something to strengthen your own stats on a specific day. Speaking of days, in Strikers there isn't any time progression outside of story events, so unlike in the main games, there's nothing really pressuring you to pick and choose things, so you can basically just sit and grind if you want, which, admittedly works well for Strikers gameplay wise, but still worth noting the difference there. \n\nThe game also lacks a lot of the Personas from 3-5 too, there's a lot, don't get me wrong, just MUCH more in the main games, though I'm not counting it as a negative thing, still plenty to choose from and you can easily use the Persona Points system (unique to Strikers, not in earlier games) and the accumulated power system to strengthen your favorite Personas. That plus the fusion system which is a Persona mainstay allow for you to easily take that level 5 weak Persona and turn him into a 99-Stat monster. \n\nThe dungeons are also different here as well, they're much more open than the ones in Persona 3, 4 and 5, while keeping the similar style that dungeons in Persona 5 had. This is mostly due to the combat being you and the Phantom Thieves against a horde of shadows every time, but it works. \n\nOverall it's pretty great. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal (or the base Persona 5) you may be somewhat lost with the terms and world of the game, but outside of the story of the Phantom Thieves and the Metaverse, you can still have a good time and know the basics. The story isn't as good as the mainline games either, likely due to it being shorter and more condensed (40 hours in Strikers vs. 100 hours in Persona 4 Golden or 150 in P5 Royal). \n\nAlso, if you're wondering about the DLC under the game, ignore the All Out Attack Pack, but definitely go and buy the legacy BGM pack, as it includes battle themes from every mainline Persona games, even the old 1990s Persona 1 and 2 that nobody remembers. It also includes the very popular themes from P3, P3P, P4, and P4G, that is to say\n\n- A Lone Prayer (Persona 1)\n-Mass Destruction (Persona 3)\n-Wiping All Out (Persona 3 Portable, from the Female Main Character's Route in that game)\n- Reach out To the Truth (Persona 4)\n- Time to Make History (Persona 4 Golden) \n\nYou actually also get the themes from Persona 5  and Persona 5 Royal IN THE BASE GAME WITHOUT DLC, you just have to beat the main story and get a game cleared save file to get access to them, but the base game does come with a pretty awesome rock remix of Last Surprise (P5's theme) in the base game before then, it's pretty neat. \n\nI'd like to end this review by engaging in the time honored tradition of port-begging\n*ahem*\n\nPLEASE ATLUS / SEGA GIVE US PERSONA 3 FES and PERSONA 5 ROYAL!\n\nThank you for reading this review and I hope it helped.",

        "content": "If you played and enjoyed Persona 5, this is a must play. ATLUS and KT Games succeed in mixing the Dynasty warriors gameplay of their games with the quality of worldbuilding, strong characters, good writing and sharp art design of Persona 5.\nThe Gameplay is action heavy and not too complex but still somehow engaging and nice to look at.\nThe game completely lacks the life sim of Persona and makes the time of the game play out as you complete specific story events. You can expect dynasty warriors gameplay but with a Persona Twist as you are able to stop time and attack your opponent(s) with a wide variety of physical and magic moves, that have different types, just like in a Pokemon Game. This adds a leven of complexity to the gameplay and preparation (SP).\nThe Game features FANTASTIC MUSIC both new and from the Persona 5 game. Also it features the good UX design from P5.\nThe game runs well on my 3070 at 4k60 max settings and my friends report a good experience even on dated Hardware like the 1060, you can expect 1080p60 max settings with a solid bit of overhead here.\nThe only thing that is a bit of a mixed bag is the difficulty, there are some spikes that could have been balanced better, and the UX during fights. (sometimes there is just tooo much happening on screen to see what your character is doing)\nIf you didn't play Persona 5: THIS GAME CONTAINS SPOILERS for that game and the Story does not properly explain the core concepts of Persona, that you need in order to understand everything well!!\nAll in all Persona5 Scramble: The phantom Strikers is a good game, that hase some flaws but is a mostly enjoyable experience.\nYou schould absolutely play it if:\n- You played and enjoyed Persona 5 and you desperately want to immerse yourself in that world again.\n- You like Dynasty Warriors Gameplay and have a solid idea of what Persona is all about\nYopu should avoid it if:\n- You are looking for a straight up Persona 5 sequel with life sim and all, this game is not that\n- you want ultra deep and complex Gameplay that is easy to learn, hard to master\n- You have never played a Persona Game or don't know what persona even is\n\nFor me PERSONALLY tha game is a 7/10\n",

I played P5 on the PS4 and dont remember it looking so good. Unfortunately the game doesnt support ultrawide monitors or frame rates above 60 fps. Bummer. Also why did I have to buy the deluxe edition to play 4 days earlier? If it werent my birthday I wouldve waited and saved $10.\n\nEdit: For whatever reason the game drops to 30fps. It was a stable 60fps when I first launched it. Until this problem gets fixed I'm not going to recommend. Get rid of denuvo too. Only hurts my performance.",

        "content": "Disclaimer: I can only recommend this game if you have already played Persona 5 (Base or Royal) because knowing the events beforehand is too important.\n\nThis game has all the level Persona 5 storytelling and the main cast that you probably enjoy. This game's twist is basically that it turns the traditional turn based Persona system into a stylish and dynamic real-time RPG with some hack-n-slash elements. Also this game is definitely quite easy until the ending where it gets somewhat challenging so I recommend to play on Hard which honestly feels kind of easy for someone new to the genre. Another gripe is that the game right now as a crashing issue and I see other people are experiencing it too - personally I have crashed like 7-8 times during my gameplay (usually when fast-travelling) so I HIGHLY recommend saving whenever you can until this issue is resolved. If you can look past these flaws, The story is solid, you'll get your values worth with ~40 hours of content, and the game is legitimately fun and addicting. \n\n8/10",

        "content": "The closest thing we'll get from Persona 5 on PC until Atlus ports the thing itself or (preferably) the Royal remake.\n\nOverall, the game is great. It is basically Persona 5-2, but with a complete change in gameplay. If you enjoyed the original game, this title is a must. I'd say this is an almost perfect adaptation from the turn-based style to a hack-and-slash type of game, keeping the same Shadows weaknesses, strengths and spells.\n\nHowever, it has its flaws. By the time I'm writing this review the game kept crashing randomly, either while loading a new in-game rendered cutscene (which can make you lose quite a bit of progress in the first dungeons) or when entering a Jail. The Anti-Aliasing messes with the text a bit (not something that makes the game unplayable, but it feels a bit weird). \n\nThe Keyboard and Mouse Button Configuration is also severely lacking. It's not as bad as only having preset controls like Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but anything to the right of \"Enter\" is unbindable, which means anyone who uses the Arrow Keys will have a really hard time playing unless they have a controller.\n\nBut still, the game is awesome and well worth of being a sequel to Persona 5.",

I'm lifting the score back up to 9.5. only had it crash about 2 time's in these 30 hours.\n\n[b]Update:[/b]\nthe game has crashed on me multiple times. At the time of this review I've had about 12 crashes. Few of them setting me back about 15 min. So for the time being I'm taking away some point. Instead of 9.5/10 I'm giving it 9/10. \n\nGreat game 9.5/10\n\na few annoying crashes and a few bug. but either way great game.\n\nNote: Don't play this game if you haven't at least watched the animation of persona 5 / P5. This game is not that standalone its still in the story of P5. It occurs after P5 so it is basically a sequel to P5. \n\nBut either way, have fun with the game.\n\nPros.\ngood graphics [In my opinion]\ngreat story\ntypical persona humour\nnot to short but not to long \n\nCons.\nannoying bugs\nfew crashes \nfew too long story scenes\n\neither way its still a 9.5/10 from me",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers certainly is a worthy successor to Atlus' 2017/2020 masterpiece.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves' sequel story was a joy the whole way through, and I'm incredibly happy to have been apart for it.  The writing is on par with the original and Royal, and while this game is more of a \"fan service-y\" type deal, Atlus made sure to not forget about what made Persona 5 great in the first place, creating a fun road trip adventure that didn't need to be told, but I'm glad it was. Seeing the thieves older and wiser while also keeping their charm and traits from the original mad me smile, and allowed me to truly see just how much these characters have grown. \n\nThe Musou style combat mixed in with Persona turn based elements came together perfectly, and while the camera can be a but weird sometimes, the combat always remained fluid and fun and never got boring even until the very end of the game. Persona fusion also makes a return, and while I have my quarrels with the new PP system, Persona Fusion is still crazy fun to do, allowing the player to create some incredibly OP Persona's that just shred enemies to a fine shadow-y paste. \n\nI became a huge Persona fan after playing Royal back in August. I never really was a JRPG guy, but for some reason Persona 5 always peaked my interest, and when I finally played it I fell in love. The Phantom Thieves are probably my favorite cast of video game characters period, and after 6 months of playing through the entire franchise, I was incredibly happy to be with the thieves on another adventure. I just hope this isn't their last.",

It's very fun to see this game take place in an action Musou format rather than an RPG. It kind of adds to the immersion in a way. Super charming to see the gang back together stealing twisted desires. Something I appreciate about this game is that it's not *just* a Warriors game, but it really feels like a bite sized Persona game with the life sim mechanics. Persona on PC in general is eye candy and super convenient to just boot up since I'm usually using my computer every day.",

I decided to give it a second chance and bought just a game. And what do i see? Technically, P5S have launched is even WORSE, than P4G. What the hell is that, Atlus? An HOUR of endless blackscreen after an animetel Phantom Thieves loading-logo and a note that i don't have any save files. And my PC have succesefully launched Code Vein, i could play smoothly. I suppose, it's because of the opening. You again repeat same mistaces, as you did with P4G. I won't change this review until you patch the game. Because i *want* to play your Persona games, but i didn't pay for a piece of piss that doesn't work properly.\n\nUPD: I've managed to fix blackscreen and get 60fps, but only with the cost cutscenes. So.... Yeah! It's just like the launch of P4G with shuttering cutscenes and constant softlock that won't allow you to play the game AT ALL this time. In P4G, at least, they were with a slight chance and while All-Out-Attack. But here - you can't start the game completly [spoiler]after first battle, scene in police departament and reunion of the gang[/spoiler]. You're simply stuck, watching at your grey phone!\n\nWhat prevented you from making exact same mistakes as in P4G? And we should again wait for 3 months?! Please, repear this game as fast as possible. I beg you.",

Music is fantastic by remixing and adding to the P5 soundtrack, it feels nostalgic but different so it doesn\u2019t get boring from what you listened to for hours in the previous game. Also, new great music that I haven\u2019t listened to much as I get distracted in the fights which come at you like raids than a tactical strategy, but still using some of the features of the old games like guns and personas weaknesses with all-out attacks.\nAnd best of all...

Really enjoying the story and the direction the game is going.\n\nMy Minor issue is the camera control can be a bit annoying a times when playing on the controller because camera when shift around when targeting an enemy and cause a bit of disorientation.\n\nMy major issue with the game right now is the random crashes during loading screens. Got few crashes and lost about couple hours of progress, but it was fine with me because I can replay through the lost pretty quickly and skip the cutscenes since I watched already. \n[b]SAVE OFTEN or WHENEVER POSSIBLE.[/b]",

If you can even call it that...\n\nP5S is a perfect hybrid of what RPG and Musou should look like. \n\nFaithful to the original game, but adding elements from warriors games to make combat fluid while maintaining difficulties and challenges (If you attack enemies without exploiting their weaknesses, prepare to get destroyed). Coupled with banger soundtracks both new and remixed, this is the game I'm more than happy to pre-order and pay full price for!\n\nWould avoid if you've not played Persona 5 as it contain major spoilers but otherwise, this is definitely a strong contender for my GOTY.",

        "content": "Considering Persona 5 is my least favorite game out of the persona games i have played, mainly due to a number of reasons like a very lacking and fast-paced story that makes it hard to believe that the phantom thieves are actually close friends because the story moves so fast you barely get any breathing room with the characters, Shido and Akechi both being pretty lacking and boring villains. (Thankfully the villain problem was fixed in Royal), plus a whole bunch of other issues that i wont bother listing now. This doesn't mean i hate Persona 5 however, i quite enjoyed it. just compared to the other games i found it lacking. this meant i didn't really have the highest of hopes going into this. While the problems of the story still going way too fast for my liking is still there i enjoyed that it actually finally felt like the phantom thieves were actual friends and the dynamic they have in this game is miles better than in the original game. The gameplay itself is a little bit rough around the edges and the 2d platforming parts are especially clunky, but besides that the gameplay is solid and fun. also being able to randomly play the battle themes from the previous games is the coolest thing ever, and it can lead to some pretty cool moments with the song matching up with the actions you are doing in the game. Persona 5 Strikers is a worthy sequel to Persona 5 and as someone that found the original lacking in some areas i was surprised by how much i enjoy Strikers.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic follow-up to Persona 5, all the while discarding the modern Persona combat in favor of a musuo experience. Fundamentally, modern Persona is defined by its balance between the RPG dungeon crawling and the life sim, tying them together with a calendar. This game removes the time constraints, making the calendar mere decoration. Moreover, social links/confidants are replaced with the Bond system, giving players access to a variety of perks of their choosing. The fusion system itself has also been greatly simplified. With all of this in mind, it seems as though this game throws out everything that made its predecessors special. However, this game gains more focus on narrative as a result of this. Many fun character interactions stem from this focus and smaller cast. It allows the game to take a form all its own, rather than being more of the same. And all the more, the battles still feel very Persona-esque thanks to ailments, follow-ups, baton passes, weakness, technicals, All-Out Attacks, Persona-switching, and more. I can't recommend this if you don't like action games. But if you even have a minor interest and you played the original/Royal Persona 5, then I heavily recommend this game. Also, the baton pass is literally a high five button now and I love it.",

However this also would cause issues with players that have not played through 5 as strikers does not do a good job of explaining characters or events too well. Gameplay wise its a fun mixture of the persona series mechanics (spells and using/collecting different personas) and some Dynasty Warriors hack/slashyness. Sophia is a likeable new addition to the roaster too. \nOverall i would give the game so far a 7/10 with high possibility to increase.",

However, you need to know the major characters from Persona 5 to be able to enjoy Persona 5 Strikers. If you have not watched or played Persona 5, please at least read the wiki pages on all the playable characters.\n\nSecond, the combat changes drastically from Persona 5 (turn-based RPG) to hack-and-slash (specifically Warrior/Musou style aka the Omega-Force style). Check out the gameplay video if you don't know what this means. Most other major Persona gameplay mechanics remain the same (protag wild card personas, level up, etc).\n\nIf you've read up to here and you're okay with everything I've said so far, this is THE GAME for you. \n\nThis game is basically everything you love about Persona 5 on steroid. This game sets during the Summer right after Persona 5 ended. You'd get to see how characters you loved from Persona 5 grow, how they use what they've learned to help people as the Phantom Thieves. One thing that I think Persona 4 did better than Persona 5 is the character development, but Persona 5 Strikers easily outrank Persona 4 on this front (partially because all characters are available and interacting since the beginning of the game).",

This is a full 40+ hour Persona game with the good ol' real-life story segments, persona fusing, and all the great cringe moments here too. I forgot it wasn't even mainly developed by Atlus, that's how good it is.\n\nIt's a full Persona 5 sequel, but the combat is just a Musou game (again, don't worry. The combat is very, VERY good, and actually kinda addicting. In some cases, it rivals the turn-based combat). And the palaces (in this game, they're called jails) are outstanding and just as good as the palaces back in Persona 5.\n\nIf you want the other Persona games to come to PC, buy this.\n\n\nEDIT: we won",

Overall this game is pure fanservice to its core, and it's as good a reason as any to get into the series.",

I started by making a social link chart and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside. I'm pretty far in my social links with the girls in the apartment next door probably 6/7 with both of them . I left them a calling card too to let them know I was going to steal their hearts I know in the game if you date multiple girls is bad but I have until valentine's Day to figure that out. Discord servers are like mementos where I can dive and debate with people until I improve the worldview of that server that's like public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too .

All the fun writing from Persona 5 is back with amped up fan service and all the excellent full group dynamics that Persona 5 needed more of, along with a couple new, intriguing characters. \n\nThe port is good. No performance problems, no complaints outside of a 60FPS cap. That is a bummer but not world-ending. That being said, the KB+M control scheme is madness. I have no idea how you use it. I recommend using a controller.\n\nI've finished the first jail (think palace) in about six and a half hours. \n\nIn summary, Haru best girl.",

It's a shame it doesn't include references or callbacks to Royal, but that's okay. \n\nThe UI is a bit too large, but you get used to it quickly. \n\nThe combat feels pretty good overall, but early on it's quite difficult, even on normal difficulty. \nYou can and probably will die almost instantly. \nIf you happen to get trapped in between a Shadow and a wall or hit with a debuff in the early areas of the game you'll most likely lose that character until the fight is over. It's honestly quite punishing and a bit frustrating at times. \n\nOnce you level up a bit and start getting bond skills to increase your health and MP it gets somewhat easier but it always seems like enemies hit a lot harder than you're expecting until you're several levels higher than they are.\n\nMaybe save the \"Hard\" difficulty playthrough for NG+.\n\nVoice acting, soundtrack, and sound design are all great. \nAll the playable characters feel unique and are very fun to use.\nOverall a very solid musou style game. Glad I purchased it. \n\nYou technically don't need to play Persona 5/Royal to understand this story, but they reference it enough where it will severely detract from the experience if you haven't played at least one of those games. \n\nThat being said; Atlus PLEASE port Persona 5 Royal to Steam, I'm glad we at least get the sequel but it feels wrong to not have the previous installment yet. PLEASE.",

        "content": "SPOILER FREE\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great game, a must play if you've played Persona 5 or Royal. Note that this is a sequel to 5, not Royal, so characters like Kasumi, and Maruki won't be in here. The story so far is great, but I did notice that there are moments where we get explained concepts that we already know, so I guess if you haven't played Persona 5 or Royal you could jump in, but you would be spoiled character outcomes and stuff like that. I expected the story to be less quality since it isn't as long as 5, but it's actually great. I'm invested into the story an the characters once again. The game runs great on PC, and it looks very nice (I played P5 on the PS3 so that's why it looks so good to me). There is original music, and there are remixes. The music is great. Nitpicks are that anti aliasing is noticeable and I would play with a controller. I have never played a Warriors game, and my friends that have tell me that it gets boring at some point. For me, its my first time so I'm having a lot of fun. I like the mix between Persona and Warriors. One mores, all outs, technicals, they all return. I've played about 25 hours, and I'm having a lot of fun. Definite recommend. If you pick it up, enjoy!",

        "content": "*SPOILER FREE*\nPersona 5 x Warriors series seems like an idea that shouldn't work but somehow it pulls it off amazingly\n\nThere have been multiple times I've genuinely forgot that this was not actually a regular persona game, running about the city talking to everyone, the interactions between characters, the cutscenes and music all just felt so natural. Even the combat itself doesn't feel out of place and seamlessly flows in and out whenever fights start.\n\nThis game has all the elements of persona 5 woven into it in an interesting way, things like baton passes, follow up attacks, persona fusing and all out attacks are still here but made to fit the hack and slash gameplay of a warriors game.\nThe difficulty is actually decent for one of these type games too, usually you just mindlessly mash buttons and feel good taking out thousands at a time but here there are fewer enemies on screen and a harder fight overall, the bosses themselves are also unique and are much more challenging than anything found in its similar titles.\n\nThe music to this game shattered my expectations, I assumed it would be good already seeing as both of the franchises have amazing music already but they really outdid themselves. I got the legacy music pack expecting to flick to that but so far i haven't even wanted to incase i missed out on any of the incredible new tracks.\n\nThe DLC for this game in terms of items is definitely skippable, it honestly doesn't do much at all and so far I haven't used any of it myself. The persona level up points may come in handy eventually but the skills haven't really been necessary, they already give you tons and if you have played a persona game before then you already know how to fuse your way to victory.\n\nThe story takes place after regular Persona 5 and not Royal. As such some players of the newer version may notice differences in character portraits or persona passives in fusing. The new character from royal also doesn't make an appearance but there are plenty more new faces added regardless\n\nThe only real gripe I have is that the game looks similar to the ps3 version of P5 and the text is a little off putting at first. I eventually got used to it but I wish there were options to make it look a bit smoother. Other than that it runs fine during gameplay with the occasional crash which can be annoying though it throws so many opportunities to save at you that the most progress I lost was 1 cutscene that i skipped upon reloading anyway.\n\nOverall I'd say this is the most amount of effort of any Koei-Tecmo mainline or spin-off game and even people who don't like their usual stuff should give this one a shot. If you are a fan of persona 5 then you really don't want to miss out on this.",

        "content": "I'm actually very, very surprised. So, a little thing about me, Persona 5 is my favorite game, of all the one's ive played, and i've played it through several times and royal the same. So when i hear about a spin off of my favorite game, i'm not only skeptical, but i feel like i had a higher expectation for this game than other games. This is a very promising game, as of current i'm only on the second (To not spoil) \"Part\". It's not just a Dynasty warrior style game with a shiny persona coat of paint on it, as it presents more of a different style and challenge than the normal copy pasted format.\n\nThe story is on par with any other persona style story: Very engaging, very in depth, and full of small fun ventures of the phantom thieves in their everyday lives as teenagers. The thing that surprised me was the game play itself. It's not just a copy or direct version of a \"Warriors\" style of game, but offers more of a twist on the combat. With the resistances of not just the larger personas, or the \"Generals\" in the other warrior games, but even all of the small fry shadows that liter the battlefield. You have to be mindful of all the resistances, all the weaknesses, and all of your parties SP and HP gauges, allowing there to be a higher skill ceiling for you to pull off some sweet ass combos. \n\nI also really enjoy that the game is difficult, it's not just \"Smash square to kill all the enemies\" like other warriors games, but it really makes you wary of all the enemies at the same time, and makes you use some brainpower to play. There are only three difficulties (Maybe more later or once i finish the game) But the game is definitely more of a challenge than i was expecting.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game. Maybe i'll update this review later once i beat the game, but for having a 14 hour save and only on the second part, i'm looking forward to how much content there is in the game, and how much more fun i will have with this game. If you like Warriors style games, this is an easy grab, just expect it to be harder than usual. If you're a persona fan, it's got all your favorite characters, plus some new ones (Especially one super adorable character), and it currently has the persona style story. I'm a fan Atlus, you did it for me.",

        "content": "TL;DR - If you really enjoyed playing Persona 5 (and have finished the game), then this game is for you.\n\nIf you've played/finished Persona 5 then this game is highly recommended as it continues the story from there. Although in this game it changes from a turn-based gameplay into an ARPG format, it doesn't mean that you can simply turn your brain off and monkey brain button mash your way through the levels (unlike the Dynasty Warriors franchise). You'll still need to acquire \"some strategy\" in order to not get completely rekt as you progress though the story. The game honestly feels more like a Persona 5 game with ARPG mechanics  rather than another Dynasty Warriors game. Plus, prior knowledge from playing Persona games in general (persona weaknesses, all-out attacks, etc) just adds to the level of expertise that you'll gain from playing this game.",

Feels like a worthy follow up to one of the best games ever made. PC port is also really nicely done. However, none of that matters\n\nWhat matters is that Atlus is using this to test the waters on the PC market. If this sells well, there's a good chance we might get Persona 5 Royal on PC. After seeing how beautiful this game looks at 1440p at 60FPS, we NEED Persona 5 Royal on PC.\n\nPlease buy this. I beg of you.",

I get that typical persona feel I got when playing the the base game. I do think that it is a steep price but i have no idea how long the game is so it might be worth the price but i will say it is worth the money but opting to wait for a sale might be the better idea in this case.\n\nIf i were to give a rating on this i would give it a 75/100 since there are a few nuances and isn't the greatest  but still a really enjoyable game and would highly recommend especially if your a persona fan",

You would really be doing yourself a disservice playing this before going through the prior one. \n\nOtherwise, this game is pretty fun. The music, art design, and dialogue are still great. The combat system is average, and the camera can really screw you over in tight areas. Also, the entire social life system is gone for this one. You don't really ever get a choice in what you do, as the game just pushes you from one event to the next. The characters that return are amusing, but they are snapshots of themselves from the end of Persona 5 so don't expect any real character development. I still recommend this though for fans of the previous game, because the charm mostly remains.",

As a Dynasty Warriors crossover, I feel it's a bit lacking? It doesn't quite have that 'one versus a thousand' feeling of being a badass, combat is a bit more small-scale and implements a lot of Persona gameplay for better or worse. \n\nThe story's been great so far, the new characters are really interesting, and goddamn does the P5 aesthetic continue to kick ass.\n\nLike I said, an overall recommendation from me, but I'm not exactly sure who this gameplay's intended for, while it's not *bad* it doesn't really appeal to me as a Persona fan, nor as a Warriors fan. It's a strange blend of the two that will probably work for you more if you *don't* share a fondness for both source materials, oddly enough. But it's still fine for what it needs to do and you should be here for the story. The gameplay's not bad enough to detract from that.",

        "content": "I'll try to go into some detail about why I don't recommend the game, but first I'll give a shorter version to be concise.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nThe game is reasonably fun, but the Warriors-style combat does not mix very well with the Persona aspects.\nThe subtle parts of writing, which the Persona series is well-known for, is missing almost entirely here.\n\nIs this a [i]BAD[/i] game?\nNo, but I am forcing myself to complete it, vs. doing so because I enjoy it.\n\n[h1]The Long Version[/h1]\n\nI could ramble for a while, but while playing, I found myself consistently complaining to myself about several several issues, which other games (including games from both the Persona series, and the Warriors games) do better, which lower my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n* Persona-series influence on combat\n* High-level structure of the game, and clashing elements\n\nBefore I go into some of these, I want to point out, there are other topics I [i]could[/i] talk about at length, but won't be. These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n",

        "content": "Important note that this is SEQUEL to Persona 5 and should not be your jumping on point for the series. You should play and beat either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this in order to not spoil yourself on characters and events, the game assumes you have beaten that game. \n\nTo sum it up briefly, Strikers takes all the trappings from P5 and mixes in a battle system that feels like an Action-RPG in a musou's trench coat, in which you need to pay attention to weaknesses and strengths of both your team and your enemy. The game runs incredibly smooth as well, though it seems to have a 60 fps cap if that matters at all to anyone. The plot even follows a similar progression to the main game, so it can also be host to bout of nostalgia if it's been a while since you originally danced with the Phantom Thieves.  Most of the time management mechanics have been removed and you don't need to worry about hustling or figuring out who is the best to spend your time with. There are still moments where you can miss limited time items or side requests if you push on ahead without completing them. You can exit and enter dungeons without penalty and are otherwise encouraged to do so to replenish your HP and SP. Combos feel really good and even incorporate Persona skills, so you always have an avenue to attack enemy weaknesses. All the new characters are also great additions as well, and mesh well with the returning cast. \n\n30 hours in, I can still say that it should provide any P5 fans both a new and familiar experience, and it stands as probably one of my favorite Musou games, based on both the quality of the writing and the fantastic combat.  \n",

I've been having a blast and I love how the voice actors came back and voiced their characters with more enthusiasm (Especially Ryuji). So yeah, it's a great game and I recommend it.\n\n\nUpdate: Now that I have finished the game I can properly say that this game is an amazing sequel to the original persona 5 and a true love letter to the fans. Even though p5 is getting milked to all hell, you can tell that they put the effort and made a great game which recaptures the vibe of the original while still being completely different. I do recommend however to save frequently as the game crashed twice throughout my playthrough and caused me to lose approximately 2 hours of progress.",

        "content": "[h1][b]A surprisingly great mash-up between [i]Musou game[/i] and [i]Persona[/i] game[/b][/h1]\n\nCombat works much more like your typical [i]Musou[/i] game, a real time hack'n slash, while also incorporates the tactical playstyle of Persona/SMT games (ie. exploiting foe's ailment weakness, 1-more/press-turn battle system, collecting personas/demons). You're in for a fresh change of pace if you came from the original turn-based combat of the Persona/SMT games.\nHowever, the negotiation system that was used in P5/P5R is absent from this game, I personally find it disappointing. Although, I think some people might find it more likeable since you don't need to went through the pain of figuring out the demon's personality, you can now just collect personas by collecting the mask that drops from battle.\n\nGraphics while not that amazing, are still stylish as it were in the original P5/P5 royal. If you like both the art direction and the graphics of the original game, you'll feel right at home when playing this game.\n\nMusics are great, some are remixes from the original P5 soundtracks, others are new addition for P5S.\n\nStory drags down a lot for the first 2 hours, and also recycle lot of story elements from the original P5 for the character's development, but there's a new story elements found in the new addition of Jails, another type of Metaverse that becomes the dungeon in P5S. I'll update my review for the story part after completing the game, for now I'll say that it feels like a bit watered down version compared to P5(I find P5R to be better than this one).\n\nPerformance is smooth, this game is highly optimized for a first port of current-gen persona game, the game managed to stay at 60fps in my GTX 1650 Ti, with all the settings maxed out in 1080p.",

        "content": "If you are a fan of Persona games, pick this up! Does not have all the \"slice of life\" activities that Persona game's are famous for, but is still story rich. New character \"Humanity's Companion\" is cute as F***. Not recommended for those just looking for a new hack n' slash, a lot of dialogue disrupts the pacing. Fans are used to it, you have been warned.\n\nPros------------------------\n\n-Unique Mushou combat experience with Persona 5 theme. All out attacks, Persona System\n\n-Story picks up after events of Persona 5 after one year\n\n-Music is great\n\n-English Va's put on a great performance (subjective I understand)\n\n-Japanese voices are optional if you are not into English dubs \n\n-New Baddies (I have only fought the first boss so far) \n\n-Checkpoints are placed pretty well and makes re-entry less of a hassle taking out a lot of backtracking.\n\n-Humanity's Companion > Siri\n\n-Ambushing shadows feels great\n\nCons-------------------------\n\n- Camera can be wacky\n\n- Game is not good for players who have not played the original. No backstory, no summary of events, no recap of the original game whatsoever. \n\n- If you have not played the original, you will not be used to dialogue. There is a TON of dialogue. Great if you are a fan, annoying if you are new to the series or are just looking for a hack n' slash.\n\n- Most of the characters you bonded with in last game are MIA if they were not the main cast. Doctor, where you be? :<\n\n- \"Stealth\"    Yeah, it's pretty whack.",
